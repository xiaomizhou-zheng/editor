          // https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror-view/pull/116

          // This fix removes the selectionToDOM from the view
          // prior to selectionToDOM being called.
          // selectionToDOM checks if there is an "active"
          // mouseDown, and if so, it delays running logic
          // which causes the table selections issue.

          // The handleDOMEvents are called before ProseMirror
          // events fired on the editable DOM element.
          // This means the view.mouseView will not yet be
          // created when the mousedown event starts.
          // https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#view.EditorProps.handleDOMEvents
          //
          // Because selectionToDOM is only added to the script
          // tasks queue following the mousedown event, we can
          // prepend a task which will clear the mouseDown from
          // the view. We do this using a setTimout with no
          // interval.
