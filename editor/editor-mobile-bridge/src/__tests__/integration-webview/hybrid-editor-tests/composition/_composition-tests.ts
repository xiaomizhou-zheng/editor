   * As a Rich Text Editor, one of the biggest differences between
   * text input on desktop and handheld devices is that text insertion
   * dispatches Keyboard Events for external hardware keyboards
   * (e.g. those use on a laptop or desktop computer), and Composition
   * Events for software keyboards.
   *
   * This input distinction is handled internally within ProseMirror
   * where different code paths are taken before ultimately updating
   * the DOM with the expected content.
   *
   * Prior to running tests on real mobiles we were blind to the impact
   * of changes we made to the editor codebase and how they may affect
   * mobile users.
   *
   * Note that compositional input is also used on desktop for certain
   * non-english keyboards with extended character sets (e.g. Japanese 'Katakana')
   *
   * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CompositionEvent
   * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent
   * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/IME_handling_guide
   *
   * These tests use `page.tapKeys` which taps each individual letter on
   * the software keyboard to trigger composition events.
   *
   * Alphanumeric input sends composition start & update events, and the
   * space key sends the composition end event to commit the inut value.
