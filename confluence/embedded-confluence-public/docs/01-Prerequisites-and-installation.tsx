  # Prerequisites

  3rd party products should make sure the Confluence cookie is properly set while integrating with any of the components. The cookie should contain 2 tokens: \`'atl.xsrf.token'\`, and \`'cloud.session.token'\`. The cookie can be obtained upon login to [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence).

  ## List of Prerequisites specific to Embedded Pages (EP)

  - 3rd party product needs to install EP from the public NPM registry.

    - _Recommended \`Node.js\` version: **v16.14.2** or above_

  - 3rd party platform needs to be in React as EP only provides \`React\` Components currently.

    - _Recommended version: **v16.8.0** to **v17.0.0**_

  - 3rd party must already have a tenant properly allocated with Atlassian and have x amount of published pages that exist within their tenant that they want to display.

    - _Process to obtain a tenant/Atlassian ID/license is **not** included in this setup process._

  - Needs to be integrated into applications with browser environments. This can include most browsers and desktop applications.

    - _Certain cookie restrictions may need to be disabled. \*_

  - The 3rd party will need to reach out to Atlassian/an Atlassian representative and provide the domain used by the 3rd party application for Atlassian to allowlist. For example, _**“teams.microsoft.com”**_
    - _If applicable, please also provide the Confluence tenant resource(s) for the Confluence content that the 3rd party application is trying to load via Embedded Pages. For example, **\*.atlassian.net** or **\*.services.atlassian.com**_
    - _The embedding product should use an agreed upon key to set the required property,_ \`parentProduct\` _for EP components. This key is used to check for the whitelisted domains and tenants for the parent product. For example: **JSM** has to set_ \`parentProduct={'JSM'}\` _as a property for_ \`ViewPage\` _and_ \`EditPage\` _components._

  ## Temporary Prerequisite \*

  - On top of successfully logging in to Confluence, an end user may need to enable all cookies, including 3rd party cookies, on their browsers while loading Embedded Pages.
