  New tokens will be visible only in applications configured to use the new Tokens API (currently in alpha).

  These changes are intended to be interoperable with the legacy theme implementation. Legacy dark mode users should expect no visual or breaking changes.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`47f58da5946`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/47f58da5946) - ED-13322, ED-13324, ED-13326, ED-13323, ED-13204: Upgrade and support react-intl@^5.18.1 including breaking API changes, types and tests in atlassian-frontend packages

  What changed: Upgraded our react-intl support from ^2.6.0 to ^5.18.1. This means editor packages now rely on consumers installing ^5.18.1, otherwise editor usage of react-intl will mismatch with actual installed react-intl APIs.
  Why change was made: As part of a coordinated upgrade effort across AF packages, as react-intl v2 is quite dated.
  How consumer should update their code: Ensure react-intl ^5.18.1 is installed in consuming applications.

  Upgrade guide: To consume atlassian-frontend packages that use react-intl5 setup a second provider for the new version, using an npm alias

  ```js
  "react-intl": "^2.6.0",
  "react-intl-next": "npm:react-intl@^5.18.1",
  ```

  ```js
  import { IntlProvider } from 'react-intl';
  import { IntlProvider as IntlNextProvider } from 'react-intl-next';

  return (
    <IntlProvider
      key={locale}
      data-test-language={locale}
      locale={locale}
      defaultLocale={DEFAULT_LOCALE}
      messages={messages}
    >
      <IntlNextProvider
        key={locale}
        data-test-language={locale}
        locale={locale}
        defaultLocale={DEFAULT_LOCALE}
        messages={messages}
      >
        {children}
      </IntlNextProvider>
    </IntlProvider>
  );
  ```
