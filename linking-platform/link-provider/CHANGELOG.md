### Minor Changes

- [`3d99b313302`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/3d99b313302) - `CardClient` and `EditorCardProvider` members now accept second optional argument called `baseUrlOverride`.
  When provided, first argument `envKey` is ignored and provided override url is used as a base for object-resolver-service calls.
