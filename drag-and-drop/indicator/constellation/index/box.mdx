This package provides a `<DropIndicator/>` component to draw drop indicators (lines) relative to box elements (eg `<Card/>`
`)

```ts
import { DropIndicator } from '@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-indicator/box';
```

When performing reordering operations a drop indicator is used to communicate the intended resting place of the `draggable` item. The orientation of the drop indicator should always match the direction of the content flow.

  title="Positioning"
>


Ensure that the parent element of the `<DropIndicator/>` has [non-static positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position). The drop indicator uses `position: absolute` so will be positioned relative
to the closest ancestor with non-static positioning.

Generally, you will want to add `position: relative` to the element you want to position the line against.

## Edge

Use `edge` to specify which edge of the drop target the drop indicator should be rendered on.

<Example Component={ClosestEdgeExample} />

In order to help people be successful with performance, we have made `edge` a *required* prop. This will force you to only render the indicator when it is relevant (minimising `react` and DOM nodes)

<Example Component={ConditionalExample} />

## Gap

Use `gap` to specify the distance between each draggable item.

The line will be drawn at an offset of half this value, resulting in the line being drawn between draggable items.
