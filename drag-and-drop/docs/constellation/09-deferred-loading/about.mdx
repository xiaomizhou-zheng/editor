title: Deferred loading
description: Improving performing by delaying the loading of drag and drop
---

If you want to, you defer the loading of `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop` (and other packages) at a point after initial page load using _dynamic imports_.

Deferring the loading of drag and drop behaviour has some advantages:

- Faster initial page loads
- The ability to load in drag and drop behaviour when it is needed, rather than in the critical bundle

There are also some drawbacks:

- Additional complexity as you are no longer simply importing a module and using it
- _Potential_ to miss an interaction: let's say a user starts trying to drag before `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop` is loaded, then the user would not be able to perform a drag operation. You can add some instrumentation to detect when these 'misses' occur. In our initial observations we have found the 'readiness' gap to be extremely small.

Given `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop` is tiny, you will already get great performance by simply using the library. Deferred loading unlocks another level of wins.

## Dynamic imports

Modern bundles often support _dynamic imports_; which sounds scary, but in user land it is straightforward:

```ts
import('module-name').then(module => {
  // use the module
});

// or using await
const module = await import('@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/element');
```

You can use _dynamic imports_ to do things like deferring the import of a module until a `react` `useEffect`.

```ts
import React, {useEffect} from 'react';

function Card() {
  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const controller = new AbortController();

    (async () => {
      const { draggable } = await import('@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/adapter/element');
      if (controller.signal.aborted) {
        return;
      }
      const el = ref.current;
      if(!el) {
        return;
      }

      const cleanup = draggable({
        element: el,
      });
      controller.signal.addEventListener('abort', cleanup, { once: true });
    })();

    return () => {
      controller.abort();
    };
  }, []);

  return <div ref={ref}>Drag me<div>
});
```

For Atlassian's we recommend using the new [@atlaskit/react-async](http://go/react-async).
