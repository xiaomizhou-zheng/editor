## Drag and drop

Drag and drop interactions rely on pointer-only only gestures and are not operable for all users. Users for whom gesture-based input is not possible include:

- Keyboard users
- Desktop screen reader users
- Mobile screen reader users (iOS and Android)
- Voice Control users

For this reason, drag and drop interactions should have alternative flows that are keyboard and screen reader operable.

## Our accessibility approach

`@atlaskit/drag-and-drop` is powered by the browser drag and drop API, which has no built-in accessibility story. To ensure that your experience is accessible, we recommend the use of *alternative flows*.

Alternative flows should allow users to complete tasks without using dragging gestures. The structure of alternative flows do not have to mirror drag and drop flows, as long as they enable users to achieve the same *outcomes*.

There is no universal alternative flow that will work for all experiences. We have created tooling, guidelines, and examples that will allow you to successfully make alternative flows.

Designers working on experiences with drag and drop interactions should specify alternative flows not reliant on dragging gestures. These flows can be tailored to the specific type of interaction that drag and drop is being used for.
