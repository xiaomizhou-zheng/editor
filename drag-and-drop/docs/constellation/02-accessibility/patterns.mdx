Alternative flows can be implemented in a variety of ways.

For reference, we've collected some patterns for alternative flows. These are not expected to be implemented exactly as shown and can be adapted where necessary.

## Inline buttons

<!-- ![Something](images/inline-buttons.png) -->

Buttons can be placed inside draggable items, providing directional input.

## Dropdown menus

Each menu item corresponds to a list that can be moved to. These options are presented in the same order that the lists are displayed to the user.
	
Menu items can provide directional input.

Items can be added to provide shortcuts like ‘move to top’.

## Toggles
	
Toggles can be used to show or hide edit controls.

This pattern can be combined with other patterns.

## Modal dialogs

Modals can be used when a form is needed.

## Select and move

A move mode can be triggered where only drop targets are focusable/clickable.

The item(s) being moved are selected, then an anchor item is chosen. Item(s) are moved above or below the anchor item.
