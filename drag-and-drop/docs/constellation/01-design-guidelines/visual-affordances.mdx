## Sorting items

Pragmatic-dnd has been architected for blazing fast performance. By employing low-level platform APIs to do the heavy lifting for us, pragmatic-dnd gains performance benefits and bundle size reductions compared to similar drag and drop implementations. However, these APIs also have limitations which affect the end user experience.

Pragmatic-dnd foregoes computationally demanding physical interactions and instead, uses drop indicators to communicate where a draggable object will be moved to at the completion of a drag operation.

### Drop indicator

DO: Use drop indicators to convey intended sorting order during drag operations.

When reordering draggable items within drop targets, a drop indicator is used to communicate the intended resting place of the draggable item. The orientation of the drop indicator should always match the direction of the content flow.

#### Drop indicator visual properties

| Property        | Value / Token         | Description                   |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `border-radius` | `0`                   | Drag target line radius       |
| `border-width`  | `2px`                 | Drop indicator line thickness |
| `border-color`  | `$color.border.brand` | Drop indicator line color     |

### Drop indicator positioning

To clearly communicate the resting place of a draggable item during a drag operation, the drop indicator should be positioned half way between draggable items.

<SectionMessage>


The position of the drop target can be calculated using the formula `(x-y)/2`, where `'x'` is the gap between items, and `'y'` is the drop indicator border width.

</SectionMessage>


To put the above formula into practice, let's look at a few examples:

#### Gaps between draggable items

In this example, let's consider a board column with a gap of 16 pixels between each draggable item.

Gap between items (x) = **16px**

Drop indicator border width (y) = **2px**

Drop indicator position (16px - 2px)/2 = **7px**

![](/images/example--list--gap.png)

#### No gap between draggable items

In this example, let's consider a list that doesn't have a gap between items and instead uses a dividing line to demarcate the boundary between items.

Gap between items (x) = **0**

Drop indicator border width (y) = **2px**

Drop indicator position (0 - 2px)/2 = **-1px**

## Moving items between drop targets

While many other drag and drop libraries mimic physical interactions between draggable items and drop targets, the constant repositioning, re-rendering, and animating of items in real-time is computationally expensive and can negatively affect performance.

In lieu of these physical interactions that would normally provide users with direct feedback during drag operations, pragmatic-dnd changes the visual properties of drop targets instead.

### Drop target

DO: Provide real-time feedback during drag operations by updating the visual properties of drop targets.

**Resting state** `isOver={false}`

| Property     | Value / Token           | Description                  |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `background` | `$color.surface.sunken` | Drop target background color |

**Active state** `isOver={true}`

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--drop-target--over.png" />
  <figcaption>

    item over it provides them with real-time feedback that item can be dropped
    there.

</figure>

| Property           | Value / Token                | Description                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `background-color` | `$color.background.selected` | `Drop target background color` |

### Nested drop targets

Drop targets can be nested within each other. As an example, nested drop targets are used in Jira boards: when dragging issues to change their status, some columns provide multiple drop targets for related statuses.

To align with this existing visual language, nested drop targets use dashed borders and background colour changes to provide visual feedback during drag operations.

**Resting state** `isOver={false}`

When nested drop targets are present, they don't become visible until a drag operation is initiated by the user, at which point the nested drop targets are displayed.

| `background-color` | `$color.surface.sunken` | Drop target background color |
| `border-style`     | `dashed`                | Drop target border style     |
| `border-width`     | `2px`                   | Drop target border thickness |
| `border-color`     | `$color.border.brand`   | Drop target border color     |

**Active state** `isOver={true}`
