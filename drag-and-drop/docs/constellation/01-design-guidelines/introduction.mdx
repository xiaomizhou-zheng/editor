## Guiding principles

### 1. Optimise for performance
Pragmatic-dnd is a performance oriented drag and drop library that builds upon existing APIs provided by the browser to provide consumers with performance gains, asynchronous loading, and package size reductions. Custom add-ons can be created by consumers to extend the native functionality provided by pragmatic-dnd. Any undertakings to extend functionality should approach the problem space with performance and optimisation top-of-mind.

### 2. Provide clear user feedback during drag and drop operations
Due to limitations of the browser-provided APIs that underpin pragmatic-dnd's implementation, drop targets and visual property changes provide the user with critical real-time feedback during drag operations.

When extending the core library with a custom package, or when alternative visual styling is necessary, it's imperative to provide users with adequate feedback so they understand the result of their actions.

### 3. Create accessible alternative experiences for drag and drop interactions
Unlike some other drag and drop libraries that provide accessible interaction methods out-of-the-box via keyboard and screenreader support, pragmatic-dnd's reliance on browser-provided APIs precludes us from providing a similar level of support.

After investigating our options and reviewing with the Accessibility Team, we've created a guide to help you craft alternative experiences that champion equality. Where possible, our recommendations leverage Atlassian Design System components which have been created with accessible standards in mind.

## Anatomy and definitions

### Draggable
A DOM node that can be picked up, moved, and dropped over drop targets to perform sorting and moving operations.

### Draggable source
Upon drag, the original draggable object stays in its original position and its visual properties change to reflect that it is in a disabled state. In this state, the draggable object is known as the draggable source.

We recommend updating the visual properties of draggable source content into a disabled state using colour tokens. [Link to relevant colour tokens docs]. In addition, reducing the opacity of the draggable source helps to shift focus onto the drag preview that is dragged by the user.

### Drag preview
Upon drag, the browser renders a static image of the draggable object which is removed from the normal document flow and is positioned relative to the cursor so it can be dragged by the user. Once the drag preview has been dropped on a valid drop target by the user, the draggable source is removed from its original location and rendered in its updated position.

<SectionMessage appearance="warning">

Due to limitations of the platform APIs that underpin pragmatic-dnd's implementation, the drag preview generated by the browser prevents the customisation of cursor, opacity, and box-shadow properties. Unfortunately, we cannot inspect the drag preview to provide you with these default properties as the drag preview is rendered outside of the DOM.

Other visual properties can be modified using a workaround method [link to guide once it exists].

### Drop target
Drop targets are containers that draggable elements can be dropped on.

`isOver=['false'|'true']`

The appearance of a drop target can be modified in response to a draggable object being dragged over a drop target to provide the user with visual feedback.

### Sortable
A list of draggable objects that can be reordered within a drop target.

### Drop indicator
When reordering draggable items within drop targets, a line is used to denote the intended resting place of the draggable item once the drag operation is completed.

### Edge detection
When a user drags an item to rearrange its order or to move it between drop targets, it's important to communicate the desired resting place of the item throughout the duration of the drag operation.

Pragmatic-dnd employs an edge detection to understand the positional relationship between draggable objects and drop targets. This positional information is used to provide user feedback through the display of drop indicators for reordering operations, or the change of visual properties when moving items between drop targets.
