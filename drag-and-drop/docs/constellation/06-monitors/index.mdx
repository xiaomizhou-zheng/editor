title: Monitors
description: Monitors can listen to all events for a particular entity type (eg elements).
---

## Basic usage

```ts
// monitors are exposed through adapters
import { monitorForFiles } from '@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/adapter/file';

// listen for all drag events for files
const cleanup = monitorForFiles({
  onDragStart: () => console.log('I am called whenever any file drag starts'),
});
```

A _monitor_ can be located anywhere and is not tied to any element.

```tsx
// basic usage with react
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { monitorForElements } from '@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/adapter/elements';

function App() {
  // It is often convinant to tie monitors to components using effects
  // By doing this you can ensure you monitors are cleaned up
  // when a component is no longer being used.
  useEffect(() => {
    return monitorForElements({
      onDragStart: () =>
        console.log('I am called whenever any element drag starts'),
    });
  }, []);

  return <div>{/*...*/}</div>;
}
```

## Conditional monitoring

A _monitor_ can be conditionally activated for a drag operation by using the `canMonitor()` function.

- `canMonitor?: (args: MonitorGetFeedbackArgs<DragType>) => boolean`

```ts
type MonitorGetFeedbackArgs = {
  /**
   * The users initial drag location
   */
  initial: DragLocation;
  /**
   * The data associated with the entity being dragged
   */
  source: DragType['payload'];
};
```

```ts
monitorForElements({
  canMonitor: ({ source }) => source.data.type === 'card',
  onDragStart: () =>
    console.log('I will only be activated when dragging a card!'),
});
```

`canMonitor()` is only called once for a monitor during a drag operation as the drag is starting. If a _monitor_ is added during an active drag, then `canMonitor()` will be called as it is created with the _intial_ drag source value and initial drag location. All monitors are called with the same `MonitorGetFeedbackArgs` value during the same drag operation. We wanted to make this behvaiour clear as the `source` value can change for external drag types in the `"onDrop"` event (eg files).

If you want to do more complicated checks, you can do those inside of your _monitor_ event listeners:

```ts
monitorForElements({
  // filtering will opt the monitor into the whole drag operation
  canMonitor: ({ source }) => source.data.type === 'card',
  onDrag: ({ location }) => {
    // Additional action filtering based on changes during the drag
    if (location.current.data.action === 'delete') {
      console.log('about to delete');
    }
  },
});
```

## Event ordering

All events flow through the system in the same way:

1. drag source (eg `draggable`) if relevant
2. drop targets - inner most upwards (bubble ordering) `grandChild -> child -> parent`
3. monitors (in the order that they were created)

_monitors_ are called in the same order in which they are created. Over time it can be hard to reason about what this ordering is as a consumer as you might be creating / destroying monitors frequently. So it is safe to expect that "monitors are called last", but you need to be careful if you want to rely on any ordering relationships between _monitors_.

```tsx
function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const cleanup = monitorForElements({
      onDragStart: () => 'This monitor gets created on each render!',
    });
    return cleanup;
  });

  return null;
}
```

## Adding monitors during an event

A _monitor_ that is added during an event (eg `onDragStart`) will not be called for the current event. This is to prevent the accidental creation of infinite loops. This behaviour matches native [`EventTargets`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget) where an event listener cannot add another event listener during an active event to the same event target in the same event phase.

```ts
const monitor1 = monitorForElements({
  onGenerateDragPreview: () => {
    const monitor2 = monitorForElements({
      // Setting up another monitor during `onGenerateDragPreview`
      onGenerateDragPreview: () => {
        // monitor2 will not be called for the _current_ `onGenerateDragPreview` event
      },
      // The monitor will be called for subsequent events
      onDragStart: () => {},
    });
  },
});
```
