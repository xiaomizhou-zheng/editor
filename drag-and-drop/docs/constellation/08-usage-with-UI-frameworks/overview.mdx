title: Usage with UI Frameworks
description: How to use @atlaskit/drag-and-drop with different UI libraries and frameworks
---

`@atlaskit/drag-and-drop` has been designed to be used with any UI library or framework.

This was a deliberate technical decision which allows us to:

- be as close to the metal as possible to get fantastic performance.
- support deferred loading without needing to lean into any library specific abstractions.
- have drag and drop between pieces of UI written in different UI libraries.
