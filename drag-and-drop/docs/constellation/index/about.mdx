<SectionMessage>


`@atlaskit/drag-and-drop` is currently in early access and is on a `0.x` version to reflect that. There will likely be some API instability as we head towards stable versions `1.x`. We have done this to allow us the room to quickly evolve `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop` in order to meet the needs of our consumers. All API changes will be clearly communicated during `0.x`, but we won't be providing automated change tooling until we hit stable versions.

## Feature set

`@atlaskit/drag-and-drop` can be used to power any drag and drop experience on the web, of any entity type.

Some experiences you can power with `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop`:

- lists
- boards
- trees
- grid / mosaic reordering
- table column reordering
- table row reordering
- drawing
- file uploads
- resizing
- dragging between windows (experimental)

<details>
    <summary>The lower level capabilities</summary>


- Supports dragging of different entity types (eg elements, text, images, external files etc)
- Nested _drop targets_ (elements that can be dropped on)
- Flexible _drop target_ sizes
- Can add, remove, or change _drop targets_ while dragging
- Conditional dropping
- Auto scrolling
- Stickiness: a _drop targets_ can maintain selection even after it is no longer being dragged over
- [`dropEffect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer/dropEffect) control
- High frequency input updates to power high fidelity interactions

(Using the element adapter)

- Drag handles (drag a `draggable` element) by a part of it
- Conditional dragging
- Nested `draggable` elements
- Flexible `draggable` sizes
- Many options to customize the appearance of the _drag preview_ (the thing that a user drags around during a drag)
- Can add, remove, or change `draggables` while dragging (even the dragging `draggable`)
- Supports virtual list usage for extreme performance
- An element can be a _drop target_, `draggable` or both
- An element can be a _drop target_ for different entities (eg `dropTargetForElements` and `dropTargetForFiles`)

## The Pieces

    How the various pieces of @atlaskit/drag-and-drop fit together
  </figcaption>

### Adapter

A drag adapter teaches `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop` how to handle dragging a particular entity (eg [elements](/components/drag-and-drop/adapters/element-adapter), [external files](/components/drag-and-drop/adapters/file-adapter), text etc). When you use a drag adapter you will bring in the code required for that entity and no more. For example, if you use the element adapter, your application won't include any code for handling files.

A drag adapter always provides at least two pieces:

1. A way of registering _drop target_ (eg `dropTargetForElements`).
2. A way to create a _monitor_ (eg `monitorForFiles`).

```ts
import {
  dropTargetForFiles,
  monitorForFiles,
} from '@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/adapter/file';

import {
  dropTargetForElements,
  monitorForElements,
} from '@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/adapter/element';
```

A drag adapter can also provide additional pieces. For example, the [element adapter](/components/drag-and-drop/adapters/element-adapter) provides a `draggable` function which is a way of registering an `Element` as being draggable.

```ts
import { draggable } from '@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/adapter/element';

const cleanup = draggable({
  element: myElement,
});
```

### Drop targets

An `Element` that can be dropped on by something that is dragging.

```ts
import { dropTargetForFiles } from '@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/adapter/file';

const cleanup = dropTargetForFiles({
  element: myElement,
});
```

More information → [drop target](/components/drag-and-drop/drop-targets)

### Monitors

A way of listening for `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop` drag operation events anywhere.

```ts
import { monitorForElements } from '@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/adapter/element';

const cleanup = monitorForElements({
  element: myElement,
  onDragStart: () => console.log('an element started dragging'),
});
```

### Addons

An addon piece of code that impacts the control flow of your drag operation (eg [hitbox detection addon](/components/drag-and-drop/packages/hitbox)) or performs some side effect during the drag operation (eg the [auto scroller addon](/components/drag-and-drop/packages/autoscroll)).

```ts
import { autoScroller } from '@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-autoscroll';

const cleanup = monitorForElements({
  onDragStart: ({ location }) => {
    autoScroller.start({ input: location.current.input });
  },
  onDrop: () => {
    autoScroller.stop();
  },
  onDrag: ({ location }) => {
    autoScroller.updateInput({
      input: location.current.input,
    });
  },
});
```

### Utilities

Small helpers functions common tasks (eg `once` for simple memoization, `combine` to collapse cleanup functions).

```ts
import { combine } from '@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/util/combine';

const cleanup = combine(
  draggable({
    element: myElement,
  }),
  dropTarget({
    element: myElement,
  }),
);
```

## Common terms

These are some terms you will see used to refer to particular entities:

- **Drag source**: The entity that is dragging. These can be internal to a page (eg a `draggable` from the [element adapter](/components/drag-and-drop/adapters/element-adapter)) or external (eg a [file](/components/drag-and-drop/adapters/file-adapter))
- **Drag preview**: The _thing_ that a user drags around. For elements, this is generally a picture of the drag source (a `draggable` element)
- **Drop indicator**: Something that is drawn to indicate where the drag source will be dropped (generally a line). You are free to draw your own drop indicators. We also have a package of premade ones: `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-indicator`.
