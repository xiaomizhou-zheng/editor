<SectionMessage>

  At this stage we are using [entry points](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#package-entry-points) rather than exporting everything from the root of the package to ensure that _everybody_ gets the best possible bundle size without needing to rely on [tree shaking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking).

## `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop`

Contains the essential pieces of the system, and is not tied to any JavaScript framework.

- `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/adapter/element`: The [element adapter](./adapters/element-adapter) used to power drag operations of elements
- `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/adapter/file`: The [file adapter](./adapters/file-adapter) used to power drag operations of external files
- `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/types`: All of the base TypeScript types of `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop`
- `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/addon/cancel-unhandled`: An _addon_ that absorbs unhandled drags (useful when disabling the native drag preview and for file drag operations)
- `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/util/combine`: A function that will _combine_ multiple functions into a single function (useful when working with `React.useEffect`)
- `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/util/once`: A function that will only allow the provided function to be called once. This is useful if your drop target `getData()` is expensive to calculate
- `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/util/reorder`: A function to make common array reordering operations easier. This is useful when you want to reorder items in a list.
- `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/util/disable-native-drag-preview`: A function to disable native drag previews
- `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/util/scroll-just-enough-into-view`: A function that can bring an element just enough into view. Useful to avoid having drag previews cut off by scroll containers (see [element adapter](./adapters/element-adapter) for more information)

## `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-hitbox`

Add _additional_ hitbox (impact) information to a _drop target_ when it is being dragged over.

- `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-hitbox/addon/closest-edge`: an _addon_ which attaches information about what edge (top, right, bottom, left) the users pointer is closest to
- `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-hitbox/util/get-reorder-destination-index`: a utility that calculates final `index` in a list based on the closest target and closest edge
- `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-hitbox/util/reorder-with-edge`: Similar to `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/util/reorder`, but takes into account edges
- `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-hitbox/types`: All base types from this package

## `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-indicator`

`react` components to assist with drawing drop indicators (eg lines). This package uses `@emotion/react` for styling.

<SectionMessage>

  You do not need to use this component for drawing drop indicators! You can use whatever rendering and styling approach you like. These components just makes drawing lines with `react` + `@emotion/react` easy.

</SectionMessage>

- `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-indicator/box`: used for drawing drop indicators relative to box structures (lists, grids and so on)
- `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-indicator/tree-item`: (soon) used for drawing drop indicators in tree structures

## `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-autoscroll`

Out of the box, `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop` leverages the browsers built in auto scrolling for drag and drop operations. `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-autoscroll` is an optional _addon_ that provides a more natural feeling auto scrolling experience.

This auto scroller has been ported from [`react-beautiful-dnd`](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd).

## `@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-live-region`

A package that contains a singleton live region which is useful for announcing messages to screen readers. This package is an important part of our [accessibility story](/components/drag-and-drop/accessibility).
