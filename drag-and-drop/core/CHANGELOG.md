# @atlaskit/drag-and-drop

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [`1e3f9743e57`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/1e3f9743e57) - A _monitor_ that is added during an event (eg `onDragStart`) will no longer be called for the current event. This is to prevent the accidental creation of infinite loops. This behaviour matches native [`EventTargets`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget) where an event listener cannot add another event listener during an active event to the same event target in the same event phase.

### Minor Changes

- [`52403a2c11f`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/52403a2c11f) - Adding a `canMonitor()` function to _monitors_ to allow a _monitor_ to conditionally apply to a drag operation.

  ```ts
  monitorForElements({
    canMonitor: ({ source }) => source.data.type === 'card',
    onDragStart: () =>
      console.log('I will only be activated when dragging a card!'),
  });
