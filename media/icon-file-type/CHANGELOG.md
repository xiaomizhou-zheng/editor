# @atlaskit/icon-file-type

## 6.3.5

### Patch Changes

- [`8cc2f888c83`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/8cc2f888c83) - Upgrade Typescript from `4.3.5` to `4.5.5`

## 6.3.4

### Patch Changes

- [`378d1cef00f`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/378d1cef00f) - Bump `@atlaskit/theme` to version `^11.3.0`.

## 6.3.3

### Patch Changes

- [`df2bb5891ef`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/df2bb5891ef) - Use named export of base icon in all icon-\* glyphs

## 6.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [`72ef8bafec9`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/72ef8bafec9) - Add "./glyph" entry point.

## 6.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [`877e9e0b9f6`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/877e9e0b9f6) - Icon package dependency now uses carat range.

## 6.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`62968ed79be`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/62968ed79be) - Icon file type now utilises the base icon from `@atlaskit/icon`.

### Patch Changes

- [`469f36d9629`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/469f36d9629) - Icon build tooling has been updated.
- [`3de10e7652e`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/3de10e7652e) - Documentation updates and fixes to types for all icon packages.
- [`d98f1bb1169`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/d98f1bb1169) - Local build tooling improvements.
- [`3f36b048938`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/3f36b048938) - The color props have been removed from the TypeScript type definitions. The behavior has never worked with the glyphs but was included in the type definitions incorrectly.
- Updated dependencies

## 6.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`6967b72747c`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/6967b72747c) - Icon file type now ships with cjs, esm, and es2019 bundles for exported components and utils. Glyphs unfortunately aren't included and still only export cjs bundles.

### Patch Changes

- [`79c23df6340`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/79c23df6340) - Use injected package name and version for analytics instead of version.json.
- [`f922302ad53`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/f922302ad53) - Icons no longer ship with the `focusable` attribute in their glyph exports. This attribute was only required for IE11 support. This is purely a build change and has no effect on user API.

## 6.1.4

### Patch Changes

- [`0741b1556f6`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/0741b1556f6) - All icon glpyhs are now built without inline extends helpers, reducing their bundlesize.
- [`8d6c79b9055`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/8d6c79b9055) - Typedefs of glyphs have been updated to reflect an API change that occured in version 15. For context, `onClick` was removed as a functional prop but it was still supported by the types. This may have resulted in a confusing developer experience although the fundamental behaviour has been consistent since version 15.

## 6.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [`b9f0d16300`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/b9f0d16300) - Re-generated icons using a newer version of the build process

## 6.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [`c65f28c058`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/c65f28c058) - Change codemod to return raw source if it is not transforming a file.

  Otherwise it would run prettier which can lead to some invalid syntax outputted
  in edge cases. This is likely due to an issue in either `codemod-cli` or `jscodeshift`.

## 6.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [`8990bf36a9`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/8990bf36a9) - Add a missing codemod for the entrypoint change in 6.1.0

  ***

  **Running the codemod cli**

  To run the codemod: **You first need to have the latest version installed before you can run the codemod**

  `yarn upgrade @atlaskit/PACKAGE@^VERSION`

  Once upgraded, use the Atlaskit codemod-cli;

  `npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli --parser [PARSER] --extensions [FILE_EXTENSIONS] [TARGET_PATH]`

  Or run `npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli -h` for more details on usage.
  For Atlassians, refer to [this doc](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/framework/atlassian-frontend/codemods/01-atlassian-codemods/) for more details on the codemod CLI.

## 6.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`fbdf356800`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/fbdf356800) - Remove undocumented metadata export from main entry point. To import metadata instead do it from the /metadata entrypoint.

## 6.0.6

### Patch Changes

- [`5f58283e1f`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/5f58283e1f) - Export types using Typescript's new "export type" syntax to satisfy Typescript's --isolatedModules compiler option.
  This requires version 3.8 of Typescript, read more about how we handle Typescript versions here: https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/get-started
  Also add `typescript` to `devDependencies` to denote version that the package was built with.

## 6.0.5

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies

## 6.0.4

### Patch Changes

- [`d6ff4c7dce`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/d6ff4c7dce) - Removes unused (and incorrect) es2019 key in package.json

## 6.0.3

### Patch Changes

- [`f51e6ff443`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/f51e6ff443) - License updated to Apache 2.0 (previously under the ADG license)

## 6.0.2

### Patch Changes

- [`6c525a8229`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/6c525a8229) - Upgraded to TypeScript 3.9.6 and tslib to 2.0.0

  Since tslib is a dependency for all our packages we recommend that products also follow this tslib upgrade
  to prevent duplicates of tslib being bundled.

## 6.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [`db053b24d8`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/db053b24d8) - Update all the theme imports to be tree-shakable

## 6.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`87f4720f27`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/87f4720f27) - Officially dropping IE11 support, from this version onwards there are no warranties of the package working in IE11.

## 2.0.0

- [patch][29b160f](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/29b160f):

  - Simplify the icons build process

  Icons no longer need a custom `build` step to be accurate on npm. This
  has come about by renaming the `es5` folder to `cjs`. If you weren't reaching
  into our package's internals, you shouldn't notice.

- [major][80304f0](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/80304f0):

  **NOTE** Unless you are using the `iconsInfo` export, this change is not breaking.

  - Rename `iconsInfo` to `metadata` to more accurately reflect its role

  This change comes with rethinking what is exported from this object,
  which no longer includes copies of the icons. If you need to rely on the
  metadata to get the packages, each should be required by your own code.

  The `icon-explorer` has an example of how to do this.
