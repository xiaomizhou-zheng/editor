## Appearance

By default, all section message come with an icon and an area for content. A `title` and `actions` can also be added.

### Information

The `information` section message is the default appearance used to signify a change in state or important information.

<Example
  Component={SectionMessageDefault}
  packageName="@atlaskit/section-message"
/>

### Success

Use a `success` section message to let the user know that an action or event has happened successfully.

Not a common use case for section messages.

<Example
  Component={SectionMessageSuccess}
  packageName="@atlaskit/section-message"
/>

### Warning

Use a `warning` section message to help users:

- avoid errors
- manage authentication issues
- take the actions needed to avoid potentially dangerous actions
- feel certain they're making the decision, for example, in confirmation modals

These are the most common use cases for section messages.

<Example

### Error

Use an `error` section message to let the user know when:

- something destructive or critical has happened
- access has been denied
- there are connectivity issues

Not a common use case for section messages.

  packageName="@atlaskit/section-message"
/>

### Discovery

Use a `discovery` section message to signify an update to the UI or provide information around new features and onboarding.

<Example
  Component={SectionMessageDiscovery}
  packageName="@atlaskit/section-message"
/>

## Actions

Use the `actions` prop to let users act on the content in the section message.

The `SectionMessageAction` component is designed to work with the `actions` prop. In most cases you should use the section message action, but you can also use any JSX element in the `actions` array.

An action will render a button if you supply an `onClick` handler, or a link if you supply an `href`. You can override the default link component using the `linkComponent` prop; this works well with router libraries.

<Example
  Component={SectionMessageActions}
  packageName="@atlaskit/section-message"
/>
