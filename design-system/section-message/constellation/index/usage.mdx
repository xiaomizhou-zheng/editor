## Anatomy

1. **Icon and background color:** The icon and background color pairing indicates the message type and comes in the default styles for the message type.
2. **Title:** Titles should clearly and concisely indicate the purpose of the message.
3. **Description:** This should describe the issue and any action the user needs to take, if any. The message will grow along with the length of the description but should be as succinct as possible.
4. **Actions (optional):** One or more links that enable the user to act on the section message content.

## Content guidelines

- Titles should clearly describe the issue or reason for the message.
- Description text should be clear, concise, empathetic, and informative.
- Use active verbs to guide the user on any actions they need to take.
