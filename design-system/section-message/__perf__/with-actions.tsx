        You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
        commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil
        forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my
        dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my
        undertaking.
