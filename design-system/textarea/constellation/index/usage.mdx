## Usage

Use text areas to let users enter long-form plain text that spans over multiple lines and in an area that can expand in height. Text areas are normally used in [forms](/patterns/forms).
Common text area input types include plain text descriptions and messages.

## Anatomy

This is the anatomy of a text area in a form.

1. ** Label: ** Indicates the type of information the text area requires and is left-aligned directly above the input area.
2. ** Placeholder text (optional):** Avoid placeholders when possible. Never use placeholder text to communicate critical information — this is not accessible. Instead, use field labels or helper text to describe the purpose of the field and how to use it. Placeholders can be used for search fields or some short example entries to clarify.
3. ** Input area: ** This is where users enter text.
4. ** Helper text: ** Gives context about an area’s input.

## Content guidelines

- Use a combination of a concise label and supportive helper text for clarification of field input. Don’t rely on placeholder text as it is not visible at all times.
- Place helper text above the text input (below the area label) if it is necessary to understand the field.
- Use a concise label to indicate what information goes in the text area input. The label should be a noun string. For example, if the text area appears in a modal called “Create component”, the label for a description text area should only say “Description” and not repeat the modal’s title.

## Accessbility

- Label attributes for screen readers should be included for users who use screen readers to understand what the text area relates to.
- Avoid using placeholder text whenever possible. Make sure any critical information is communicated either in the field label or using helper text below the field. Search fields or brief examples are exceptions where placeholder text may be OK.
- Follow the [accessibility](/foundations/accessibility) foundations for more guidance on accessible design.
