## Default

The default form of a button, used for most cases. They are not impactful enough to represent the primary action in a container.

<Example Component={ButtonDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Variants

### Button (standard button)

The most commonly used button component. This button has different appearances, as well as supported the existing dark mode solution.

It does not support the discouraged theming approach.

```js
// from named entry point (to ensure minimum code is brought in)
import Button from '@atlaskit/button/standard-button';   

// from main entry point
import Button from '@atlaskit/button';
```

### Loading button

A small wrapper around `Button` that allows you to show an `@atlaskit/spinner` as an overlay on the button when you set an isLoading prop to true.

`LoadingButton` takes care of applying a spinner with the correct size and color based on the button spacing and appearance props.

```js
// from named entry point (to ensure minimum code is brought in)
import LoadingButton from '@atlaskit/button/loading-button';   

// from main entry point
import { LoadingButton } from '@atlaskit/button';
```

### Custom theme button

Avoid using this component. It exists for those already using custom theming, which is hard to use and has performance issues.

This theming approach will be improved in future.

```js
// from named entry point (to ensure minimum code is brought in)
import CustomThemeButton from '@atlaskit/button/custom-theme-button';   

// from main entry point
import { CustomThemeButton } from '@atlaskit/button';
```

## Appearance

### Primary

Use a `primary` button to call attention to an action on a [form](/patterns/forms) or to highlight the strongest call to action on a page.
Primary buttons should only appear once per container (not including the application header or in a [modal dialog](/components/modal-dialog)). Not every screen requires a primary button.

<Example Component={ButtonPrimary} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Subtle

Use a `subtle` button with a `primary` button for secondary actions, such as “Cancel".

<Example Component={ButtonSubtle} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Link

Use a `link` button to navigate to another page. These should open in the same window unless information may be lost (for example, when someone is filling out a form), or when the destination is an external site (for example, a knowledge base article).

<Example Component={ButtonLink} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Subtle link

Similar to a `subtle` button, but behaves like a `link` button. Use a `subtle link` button to avoid overwhelming the page with blue links.

<Example Component={ButtonSubtleLink} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Warning

A `warning` button appears before we request the user to take action, usually in anticipation of a significant change. These are found mostly in confirmation modals.

<Example Component={ButtonWarning} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Danger

The `danger` button appears as a final confirmation for a destructive action such as deleting. These are found mostly in confirmation modals.

<Example Component={ButtonDanger} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## States

### Disabled

Set `isDisabled` to disable a button that isn’t usable. Disabled buttons can cause accessibility problems, so avoid using `isDisabled`, especially for form submissions.

<Example Component={ButtonDisabled} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Selected

Set `isSelected` to indicate the button is selected.

<Example Component={ButtonSelected} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Loading

Set `isLoading` to indicate the button is loading. The button text is hidden and a spinner is shown in its place, while maintaining the width that it would have if the text were visible.

<Example Component={ButtonLoading} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Spacing

Buttons can have various spacing. Default spacing is used for most use cases, compact for tables and none for breadcrumbs.

<Example Component={ButtonPadding} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Full width

Buttons can be expanded to full width to fill its parent container.

<Example Component={ButtonFullWidth} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Button with icon

Buttons may include an icon before or after the text.

### Icon before

Display an icon before the text.

<Example Component={ButtonWithIconBefore} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Icon after

Display an icon after the text.

<Example Component={ButtonWithIconAfter} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Routing

Button's `component` prop allows a custom React component or HTML element to render
in place of a `<button>` or `<a>` element.

This is useful for using Button with the `<Link>` component from popular routing libraries.

```js
import Link from '@popular/routing-library'
import Button from '@atlaskit/button';

// Set a custom component
<PrimaryButton component={Link}>Your Work</PrimaryButton>
```
