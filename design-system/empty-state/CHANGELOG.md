- Updated dependencies

## 7.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`b5c96b26bf3`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/b5c96b26bf3) - Instrumented empty-state with the new theming package, `@atlaskit/tokens`.

  New tokens will be visible only in applications configured to use the new Tokens API (currently in alpha).
  These changes are intended to be interoperable with the legacy theme implementation. Legacy dark mode users should expect no visual or breaking changes.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies

## 7.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [`7465c0f0e1d`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/7465c0f0e1d) - Fix to account for the size/width fallback behaviour. Previously if a user provided a value for the the `width` property it would always be ignored, this is no longer the case.

## 7.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`20ea31c9fdf`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/20ea31c9fdf) - **Deprecation Warning**
  The `size` prop and `Sizes` type have been flagged as deprecated. Both are better described as a width and so internally have been renamed.
  The `size` prop will continue to work in the shortrun before it's formally removed in the component's next major release.

  Housekeeping:

  - Component now uses the new entrypoint format.
  - Prop descriptions have been updated to better describe component behaviors.
  - Small bug fix related to additional props being spread in to some of the component's internals.

  - Drop ES5 from all the flow modules

  ### Dropping CJS support in all @atlaskit packages

  As a breaking change, all @atlaskit packages will be dropping cjs distributions and will only distribute esm. This means all distributed code will be transpiled, but will still contain `import` and
  `export` declarations.

  The major reason for doing this is to allow us to support multiple entry points in packages, e.g:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/colors`;
  ```

  Previously this was sort of possible for consumers by doing something like:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/dist/esm/colors`;
  ```

  This has a couple of issues. 1, it treats the file system as API making internal refactors harder, we have to worry about how consumers might be using things that aren't _actually_ supposed to be used. 2. We are unable to do this _internally_ in @atlaskit packages. This leads to lots of packages bundling all of theme, just to use a single color, especially in situations where tree shaking fails.

  To support being able to use multiple entrypoints internally, we unfortunately cannot have multiple distributions as they would need to have very different imports from of their own internal dependencies.

  ES Modules are widely supported by all modern bundlers and can be worked around in node environments.

  We may choose to revisit this solution in the future if we find any unintended condequences, but we see this as a pretty sane path forward which should lead to some major bundle size decreases, saner API's and simpler package architecture.

  Please reach out to #fabric-build (if in Atlassian) or create an issue in [Design System Support](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=24670) (for external) if you have any questions or queries about this.
