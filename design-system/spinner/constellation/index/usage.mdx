## Usage

Spinners indicate that a system process is going on that will end with content being displayed to the user. They animate as soon as user action is initiated and disappear once the content appears.

## Best practices

- If you want a spinner that is triggered by a button, place the spinner in the button, and disable the button while the spinner is visible. If you're using the [Button](/components/button/) component, you should use the `LoadingButton` export as all of this is taken care of for you.
- If only a portion of a page is displaying new content or being updated, place the spinner in that part of the page.
- If you are unsure where to place the spinner, place it where you want the user's attention to be when loading is finished.
- Only show a spinner if the expected wait time is more than a second.
- There should only be a single spinner on a page at one time.
- If using a spinner directly over content, apply the `opacity.loading` token to the content container to de-emphasis the content and allow the spinner to be seen. See [Dynamic table loading states](/components/dynamic-table/examples#loading-states) for an example.
