## Usage

Date pickers help users navigate past, present, and future dates. 

Date picker is commonly used in [forms](/patterns/forms).

## Anatomy

1. ** Label: ** Labels should indicate what information the field requires. The label is left-aligned above the input area.

2. ** Date input field: ** Selecting this field opens the calendar component. Users can also input dates into the field. Once a date is selected, the option will be shown in the text input. This example shows date formatted in ‘dd/mm/yyyy’ but this can be customized using the `dateFormat` prop. 

3. ** Calendar: ** Contains the list of all dates. Selecting the previous or next arrows moves the calendar through months. The selected date area is highlighted by a different color fill. 

## Content guidelines

- Ensure that locale is appropriately set so that users see dates in a familiar format.
- If helper text is necessary, place helper text above the input (below the area label).
- Use a concise label to indicate what the date selection refers to.

## Accessibility

- Label attributes for screen readers should be included for users who use screen readers to understand what the date picker relates to.

Follow the [accessibility](/foundations/accessibility) foundations for more guidance on accessible design.
