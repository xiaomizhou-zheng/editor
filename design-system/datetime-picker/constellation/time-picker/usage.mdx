## Usage

Time pickers help users navigate specific times.

Time picker is commonly used in [forms](/patterns/forms).

## Anatomy

1. ** Label: ** Labels should indicate what information the field requires. The label is left-aligned above the input area.

2. ** Time input field: ** Selecting this field opens the select menu showing available times on the selected date. Once a time is selected, the option will be shown in the text input. This example shows time formatted in AM/PM but this can be customized using the `timeFormat` prop. 

3.  ** Time dropdown: ** Contains the list of all selectable times. This example shows time increments of 30 minutes but can be customized using the `times` prop. 

## Content guidelines

- Ensure that locale is appropriately set so that users see times in a familiar format.
- If helper text is necessary, place helper text above the input (below the area label).
- Use a concise label to indicate what the time selection refers to.

## Accessibility

- Label attributes for screen readers should be included for users who use screen readers to understand what the time picker relates to.

Follow the [accessibility](/foundations/accessibility) foundations for more guidance on accessible design.
