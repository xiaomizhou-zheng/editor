## Default

By default, the time field is used to select a time from the [select](/components/select) menu. The current time text is bold, underlined, and highlighted blue. 

<Example Component={TimePickerDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/datetime-picker" />

## Form

Time picker used with the [form](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/design-system/form) component includes a field label and helper text. 

<Example Component={TimePickerForm} packageName="@atlaskit/datetime-picker" />

### Validation

This is how time picker behaves within [forms](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/design-system/form).

Validation displays an error message related to the restrictions of the time picker.

When a user selects the time picker area, the focus color changes to blue. When validating time pickers in real-time, message icons switch based on the message type. 

For example, helper text becomes an error message when the input content doesn't meet the criteria. Error and warning messages disappear when the criteria is met.

Keep helper text as short as possible. For complex information, provide a link to more information in a new browser tab. Use the [messaging guidelines](/content/messaging-guidelines) for more help.

## Internationalization

### Locale

Use `locale` to display times in a format which is appropriate to users.

<Example Component={TimePickerLocale} packageName="@atlaskit/datetime-picker" />


## Time formats

`TimePicker` supports customizing the format of times. Formats are given as strings and use the syntax specified at Modern JavaScript Date Utility Library.

- `timeFormat` determined how times are formatted. 

Where possible use locale for time formatting, instead of a custom format.

Time formats should be informed by the userâ€™s locale and the use case. 

<Example Component={TimePickerFormatting} packageName="@atlaskit/datetime-picker" />

## Time editable

This allows the time field to be edited via keyboard prompts.

<Example Component={TimePickerEditable} packageName="@atlaskit/datetime-picker" />
