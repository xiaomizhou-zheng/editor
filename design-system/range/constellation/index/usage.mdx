## Usage

Use ranges in [forms](/patterns/forms) to let users select a value within a given range of minimum and maximum values.

## Anatomy

![Range anatomy](images/range-anatomy.png)

1. **Track:** The track displays the range available for the user to select from.
2. **Handle:** A position indicator that can be moved along the track to change the value.

## Best practices

- Place labels directly above the input, and align to the left.
- Do not use for ranges that are extremely large (for example, 1-1000).
- Do not use for ranges that are very small (for example, 1-3). The range moves in steps when the range of values is lower.
- Don't use a range if choosing a *specific* value is important. The slider interaction isn't as precise as explicitly typing or choosing an option from a list.


## Content guidelines

- Field label text above the range input should be short and concise.
- If necessary, use helper text to clarify how to use the range.
