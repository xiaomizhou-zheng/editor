## 7.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`78741dd1644`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/78741dd1644) - [ux] Breaking visual changes to range to afford better contrast:

  - The scrubber now applies the same color as the foreground
  - The disabled state has been altered; it's now a consistently applied opacity state overlay across the whole element
  - The input now uses :focus-visible, rather than :focus and applies an offset focus ring

## 4.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [`54a9514fcf`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/54a9514fcf) - Build and supporting files will no longer be published to npm

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`da1c8c16d4`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/da1c8c16d4) - In this version we made range dramatically faster and lighter ðŸ¤©

  ### Changes

  In `4.0.0` we bring significant performance improvements all for just the cost of 1 breaking change ðŸ˜®. That's not all folks because this update comes with a ðŸ¤‘ FREE ðŸ¤‘ codemod for you to upgrade with.

  - Range no longer has a `peerDependency` on `styled-components@3`. Internally range is now using `@emotion/core` for styling
  - A performance issue made the range noticeably laggy with large ranges. With this change we are no longer creating new classes on each step change and instead updating a css variable, making Range noticeably smoother.
  - Changed the `inputRef` prop to be `ref` which returns the `ref` of the range input using `React.forwardRef`. This new `ref` prop will accept the type of the old `inputRef` prop, `(input?: HTMLInputElement) => any`, as well as if `ref` is created with `React.createRef`.
  - A new example that shows off how to rate limit your `onChange` event

  ### Automatic upgrading

  ```
  # You first need to have the latest range installed before you can run the codemod
  yarn upgrade @atlaskit/range@^4.0.0

  # Run the codemod cli
  # Pass in a parser for your codebase
  npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli /path/to/target/directory --parser [tsx | flow | babel]
  ```

  #### Notes

  - You first need to upgrade to `4.0.0` **before** you run the codemod cli. This is because the cli will look in your local `node_modules` for the codemod which is published inside the `spinner` package.
  - The codemod is pretty clever, and will respect aliasing as well as using custom naming for the default import

  #### Ez pz lemon squeezy

  The codemod will change the `inputRef` prop to `ref`

  ```diff
  - <Range inputRef={inputRef} />
  + <Range ref={inputRef} />

  - <Range
  -   inputRef={ref => {
  -     myRangeRef = ref;
  -   }}
  - />
  + <Range
  +   ref={ref => {
  +     myRangeRef = ref;
  +   }}
  + />

  ```

- [minor][76299208e6](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/76299208e6):

  - Drop ES5 from all the flow modules

  ### Dropping CJS support in all @atlaskit packages

  As a breaking change, all @atlaskit packages will be dropping cjs distributions and will only distribute esm. This means all distributed code will be transpiled, but will still contain `import` and
  `export` declarations.

  The major reason for doing this is to allow us to support multiple entry points in packages, e.g:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/colors`;
  ```

  Previously this was sort of possible for consumers by doing something like:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/dist/esm/colors`;
  ```

  This has a couple of issues. 1, it treats the file system as API making internal refactors harder, we have to worry about how consumers might be using things that aren't _actually_ supposed to be used. 2. We are unable to do this _internally_ in @atlaskit packages. This leads to lots of packages bundling all of theme, just to use a single color, especially in situations where tree shaking fails.

  To support being able to use multiple entrypoints internally, we unfortunately cannot have multiple distributions as they would need to have very different imports from of their own internal dependencies.

  ES Modules are widely supported by all modern bundlers and can be worked around in node environments.

  We may choose to revisit this solution in the future if we find any unintended condequences, but we see this as a pretty sane path forward which should lead to some major bundle size decreases, saner API's and simpler package architecture.

  Please reach out to #fabric-build (if in Atlassian) or create an issue in [Design System Support](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=24670) (for external) if you have any questions or queries about this.
