## Usage

Use text fields in [forms](/patterns/forms) to help people enter, select, and search for text. Text fields are normally found within a form but can also be part of a modal, search, or card.

Common text input types include: usernames, descriptions, URLs, emails, addresses, and plain text searches.

## Anatomy

![Text field anatomy](images/text-field-anatomy.png)

1. **Label:** Should indicate what sort of information the field requires and is left-aligned directly above the input area.
2. **Placeholder text:** Avoid placeholders when possible. Never use placeholder text to communicate critical information â€” this is not accessible. Instead, use field labels or helper text to describe the purpose of the field and how to use it. Placeholders can be used for search fields or some short example entries.
3. **Input area:** This is where people enter text.
4. **Helper text:** Gives context about a field's input.

## Best practices

- Place labels directly above the input, and align to the left.

## Content guidelines

- For helper text provide an example or specific syntax for the input, rather than in the input area, so that it's visible after text has been entered. Only use this where clarification is required, and try not to overuse it.
- Field label text above the input area should be short and concise.

## Server

Consult [AUI](https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/latest/docs/forms.html) for implementation details.

## Accessibility

- Avoid using placeholder text whenever possible. Make sure any critical information is communicated either in the field label or using helper text below the field. Search fields or brief examples are the only exceptions where placeholder text is OK.
