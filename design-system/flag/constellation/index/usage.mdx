## Usage

Flags appear at the bottom left of the screen and overlay any content.

There are two types of flags: default and bold.

Default flags are for general, event-driven messages that are dismissible. For example, as notifications for recent activity. One common use case for default flags is as a notification about recent activity. This allows users to easily jump into a conversation or activity feed to get a quick update. In these cases, an avatar is used instead of the icon.

Bold flags are not dismissible and use [color](/foundations/color) to reinforce the severity or importance of a message. They are reserved for messages about success, loading, warnings, and errors. They can't be dismissed until the issue is resolved or the message has expired (in the case of a success message). A collapsed and expanded state exists so additional information can be shared.

## Anatomy

1. **Icon (or avatar) and title:** The title should always summarize the reason for the flag. Titles longer than the width of the flag will wrap. An appropriate icon color or user avatar should be included.
2. **Message (optional):** Provide additional information that will help users understand the flag, such as what went wrong or why this is important. Text longer than 5 lines will scroll. Try to make text as short as possible in general.
3. **Actions (optional):** A maximum of two links that enable users to act on the flag's content.
4. **Dismiss:** Use to close the flag. This is for default flags only.

## Best Practices

- Use the [color system](/foundations/color) for the usage of flags, and keep a consistent visual language.
- Keep flag titles and messages concise so users who increase zoom or those reading in languages with longer words are still able to easily read the flag. If a long message is needed, consider linking to an additional page for more information or using an alternative component such as [banner](/components/banner), [inline mesage](/components/inline-message), or [modal](/components/modal-dialog).
- When there are multiple flags, they will stack on top of one another with the most recent flag on top. When a user dismisses a flag, any older flags below will come to the top. Careful consideration should be taken to take into account the ordering and priority of flags in the stack.
- Never use dismissible and non-dismissible flags in a stack. Flags that automatically dismiss will no longer be visible to users.
- When a modal is active, flags should always be visible above the modal.

## Content guidelines

### Information

- Say why it's important.
- Get right to the point.
- Based on the situation, you can add more "wink" to your message, but keep it clear and concise.

### Warning

- Put yourself in the user's shoes.
- Make sure you're not talking about something that has already occurred (this should be an error message instead).

### Error

- Avoid blame and accept if something is our fault - "we're having trouble connecting" rather than "you're having connection issues."
- Let the user know what's causing the error, rather than writing a general error message that works for a number of things.
- Be clear and conversational by thinking about how you might explain a technical error to your non-technical friends.

### Success

- Messages that appear more frequently should have less wink and be more concise.
- Messages that appear after a bigger or more infrequent action can be more playful.

- To alert users that important information is available or an action is required use an [inline message](/components/inline-message).
- For critical messaging that requires immediate action, use a [modal dialog](/components/modal-dialog).
