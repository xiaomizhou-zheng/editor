## Default

The default form of a modal dialog.

<Example Component={ModalDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/modal-dialog" />

## Appearance

A modal dialog is available in two other variations.
The appearance needs to be set on both the modal title and the primary button.

### Warning

Warning modals appear in anticipation of a significant change.
Have empathy for people.
Inform,
but don't alarm.
If the warning comes before an action,
clearly communicate what will happen if they proceed,
and provide an alternative or opt-out where possible.

<Example Component={ModalWarning} packageName="@atlaskit/modal-dialog" />

### Danger

Danger modals are used to inform people when something potentially destructive will happen if they continue.
Explain the problem and provide a next step or an alternative.

<Example Component={ModalDanger} packageName="@atlaskit/modal-dialog" />

## Width

The width of the modal can be specified in different ways:

- The recommended way to specify modal width is using named size options.
- If a number is provided, the width is set to that number in pixels.
- If a string including pixels or a percentage is provided, the width will be directly applied as a style.

<Example Component={ModalWidth} packageName="@atlaskit/modal-dialog" />

## Focus management

Focus is moved to the first interactive element inside the modal dialog when rendered.
Pass the `autoFocus` prop an element `ref` to focus on a specific element.

<Example Component={FocusSpecificElement} packageName="@atlaskit/modal-dialog" />

## Scrolling behavior

Modal dialogs differ in width,
whereas height is determined by the content.
Once it reaches a certain threshold,
the body content will scroll while the header and footer remain fixed until the bottom of the modal dialog is reached.

The scroll behavior of modals can be configured so that scrolling happens inside the modal body or outside the modal,
within the viewport.

In either case,
modals prevent the window from being scrolled both natively and programatically.
This will prevent browser issues such as `scrollIntoView` scrolling the window instead of only the closest scroll parent.

<Example Component={ModalScroll} packageName="@atlaskit/modal-dialog" />

## Form

These internal components can be wrapped in a `form` element to support
having buttons of type `submit` in the footer.

<Example
  Component={ModalWrapper}
  packageName="@atlaskit/modal-dialog"
/>

## Custom modal

If you wish to customise a modal dialog, it accepts any valid React element
as children. In this example, we recreate an onboarding modal without
modal header, title, body, or footer.

<Example
  Component={ModalCustom}
  packageName="@atlaskit/modal-dialog"
/>

## Modal header

Modal header accepts any valid React element as children, so you can
use modal title in conjunction with other elements like an exit button
in the top right.

<Example
  Component={ModalHeader}
  packageName="@atlaskit/modal-dialog"
/>


### Custom modal header

For very custom use cases, you can achieve the same thing without modal
header or title. To make sure the modal is accessible, call `useModal`
and set `titleId` as the `id` on the heading.

<Example
  Component={ModalCustomHeader}
  packageName="@atlaskit/modal-dialog"
/>

## Modal footer

Modal footer accepts any valid React element as children. For example,
you can add an [avatar](/components/avatar/) in the footer.

<Example
  Component={ModalFooter}
  packageName="@atlaskit/modal-dialog"
/>

### Custom modal footer

For very custom use cases, you can achieve the same thing without modal
footer.

<Example
  Component={ModalCustomFooter}
  packageName="@atlaskit/modal-dialog"
/>
