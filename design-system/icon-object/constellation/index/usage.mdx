## Usage

Object icons represent an Atlassian-specific content type. They can trigger actions such as opening a page in Confluence, an issue in Jira, or a pull request in Bitbucket.

Unlike a standard icon, object icons help people identify the content type fast. This reduces cognitive load for people across products and platforms.

Object icons can be in:
- Search
- Media cards
- Smart cards
- Attachment uploads
- Activity feeds
- Inline links

## Best practices

### Color

Object icons are assigned specific colors. For cross-product and platform consistency, donâ€™t change the color of the object icon.

## Accessibility

- Use object icons in combination with a title and meta-information, such as author, creation date, or sub-heading.
- Pair object icons with [tooltips](/components/tooltip). On hover, the tooltip reveals the specific content type of the icon.
