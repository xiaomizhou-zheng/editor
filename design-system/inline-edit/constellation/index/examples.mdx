## Default

Inline edit is a wrapper around a custom input component such as a [text field](/components/textfield/). It starts in a read-only view called `readView` and users can click the field to edit it.

To prevent an inconsistent transition between read and edit mode, pass in custom `readView` and `editView` as props. Not doing this will result in
a buggy user experience where the inline edit views do not align.

You can use various types of input fields such as [text area](/components/textarea/examples) and [select](/components/select/examples). The appearance of the inline edit will vary depending on the input component it is used with.

### Text field

If you need a standard editable text field with the views already set up, consider using [inline editable textfield](/components/inline-edit/inline-editable-textfield/).

<Example Component={InlineEditDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/inline-edit" />

### Text area

<Example
  Component={InlineEditCustomTextarea}
  packageName="@atlaskit/inline-edit"
/>

### Select

<Example
  Component={InlineEditCustomSelect}
  packageName="@atlaskit/inline-edit"
/>

## Custom text

When using a [text field](/components/textfield/examples), the font size can be made larger. You can also change the line height.

<Example
  Component={InlineEditLargerTextSize}
  packageName="@atlaskit/inline-edit"
/>

## No action buttons

Action buttons include a confirm (checkmark) and a cancel (cross) button. These indicate the completion of editing and the cancellation of editing respectively.

Use `hideActionButtons` to remove the buttons and leave the field by itself. Use this when the action buttons obstruct other contents below - this is commonly seen on mobile.

If there is no obstruction, keep action buttons for accessibility purposes. The contents in the field are saved when the user navigates away from the element.

<Example
  Component={InlineEditNoActionButtons}
  packageName="@atlaskit/inline-edit"
/>

## Start with edit view

Inline edit starts in `readView` by default. You must click into the field to start editing.

Use `startWithEditViewOpen` to set it to start in `editView` instead.

<Example
  Component={InlineEditStartWithEdit}
  packageName="@atlaskit/inline-edit"
/>

## Validation

Validation displays an error message related to the restrictions of the inline edit.

These error and warning messages disappear when the criteria is met.

Try to keep the helper text as short as possible. For complex information, provide a link to more information in a new browser tab (seeÂ [messaging guidelines](/content/messaging-guidelines) for more information).

<Example Component={InlineEditValidation} packageName="@atlaskit/inline-edit" />

## Required field

Set `isRequired` when an inline edit field needs to be filled out.

<Example
  Component={InlineEditRequiredField}
  packageName="@atlaskit/inline-edit"
/>

## Stateless

In a stateless inline edit, you can manage the checked state of the input by using the `isEditing` prop.

This requires the `setEditing` handler to control the state value that you pass into the `isEditing` prop.

<Example Component={InlineEditStateless} packageName="@atlaskit/inline-edit" />
