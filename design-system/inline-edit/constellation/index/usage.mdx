## Usage

Use inline edit on screens where information needs to be updated often, such as a view issue page. Users can toggle between read view and edit view without leaving the page.

Use this instead of a [form](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/design-system/form) when you have information that may already exist that will need to be edited.

Inline edit can use but is not limited to a [text field](/components/textfield), [select](/components/select) and [datetime picker](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/design-system/datetime-picker). The appearance of the inline edit will vary depending on which components it is used with.

## Anatomy

### Read view

![Inline edit read anatomy](/images/inline-edit-anatomy-read.png)

1. ** Label: ** Labels are sentence case and are as short as possible, while clearly describing the content of the field.

2. ** Field: ** When in read view, the field is hidden and aligned with the label. When in an empty state, this field text can be customized.

### Edit view

![Inline edit edit anatomy](/images/inline-edit-anatomy-edit.png)

1. ** Label: ** Labels are sentence case and are as short as possible, while clearly describing the content of the field.

2. ** Field: ** When in edit view, the field snaps to the width of the column and the text remains aligned with the label.

3. ** Controls: ** Always appear to the right of the field.

## Behavior

Inline edit wraps around any standard text field. Any styling of the text field component is handled outside of this component. If you are placing a custom inline edit on a component like a header, ensure that the font and box size line up properly.

Since inline edit is used when entering content, it is optimized for use with keyboard inputs (use return to save and esc to cancel). When using a mouse, controls should always display on the bottom right of the field.


## Best practices

- Use inline edit for an editable field that is not part of a [form](/patterns/forms). Do not use inline edit inside of a form.

<DoDont
  type="do"
  image={{
    url: inlineEditDo,
    alt: 'Inline edit header in read view and edit view with the same styling and layout.'
  }}
>
  Ensure read view and edit view components have identical styling. This avoids confusing the user.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
  type="dont"
  image={{
    url: inlineEditDont,
    alt: 'Inline edit header in read view and edit view with the same styling.'
  }}
>
  Pass in read view and edit view components that have different styling.
</DoDont>
