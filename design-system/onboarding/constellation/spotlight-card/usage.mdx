## Usage

The spotlight card is flexible and can be tailored for different contexts. You should design the content of your card to support the goal of your design and message.

## Anatomy

1. **Stepper:** Step through a series of cards to communicate multiple benefits of a single focus element or related task. Avoid using this to show the actual steps of a task, and always use as few steps as possible.
1. **Secondary button:** Include a primary and secondary action. Best practice is to always allow the user to dismiss the spotlight.
1. **Spotlight area action:** Include a call to action for the user to interact with the spotlit feature.
1. **Illustration:** Include an illustration if it enhances the understanding for the user, and doesn't distract. Illustrations should relate to the spotlight content or benefit.
1. **Heading:** Include a heading to inspire or draw the user into a message.
