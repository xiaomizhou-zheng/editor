## Default

To implement a spotlight, you should first wrap your screen or app in a `SpotlightManager`. Where you want to place a spotlight, import `Spotlight`, `SpotlightTarget` and `SpotlightTransition`.

`SpotlightTransition` will handle the animation of spotlights as they render in. It should wrap any `Spotlight` components. `SpotlightTarget` should wrap your spotlight target.

<Example Component={SpotlightSingle} packageName="@atlaskit/onboarding" />

## Tours

Spotlights can be connected in multi-step onboarding tours. Only one spotlight should be shown at a time.

<Example Component={SpotlightTour} packageName="@atlaskit/onboarding" />

## Blanket tint

If you would prefer the spotlight to appear without the tinted blanket background, set the `blanketIsTinted` prop to `false` on the `SpotlightManager` component.

<Example Component={SpotlightBlanketIsTinted} packageName="@atlaskit/onboarding" />

## Actions

### Appearance

You can change the default action button appearance to `subtle` or `subtle-link` with the `appearance` property on the action object. Spotlights should generally have one default action that leads the user through the onboarding process or prompts an action, with other actions such as "Skip" using the subtle appearance.

<Example Component={SpotlightActionsAppearance} packageName="@atlaskit/onboarding" />

### Actions before element

To add a left-aligned element before the action buttons, use the `actionsBeforeElement` prop. One use case for this is adding a step number to an onboarding tour with 3 or more steps.

<Example Component={SpotlightActionsBefore} packageName="@atlaskit/onboarding" />

## Heading

To add a heading to a spotlight, use the `heading` prop. For content guidance, see the [usage tab](/components/onboarding/usage).

### Heading after element

The `headingAfterElement` prop allows you to place an element to the right of the heading. This is sometimes used to implement a close icon button in a spotlight.

<Example Component={SpotlightHeadingAfterElement} packageName="@atlaskit/onboarding" />

## Image

You can add an image to a spotlight with the `image` prop. Most Atlassian illustrations are designed to work with neutral backgrounds, so you may need brand design support to implement an ideal spotlight image.

<Example Component={SpotlightImage} packageName="@atlaskit/onboarding" />

## Pulse

When spotlights are active, a pulsing outline helps draw attention to the target. It's possible for you to use this spotlight pulse in custom ways. For example, you can apply the pulse on the target element _before_ the spotlight is active, and trigger the spotlight the first time a user interacts with it.

<Example Component={SpotlightPulse} packageName="@atlaskit/onboarding" />

## Dialog placement

By default, a spotlight dialog will be positioned to the "bottom left" relative to the target. You can change this by setting your desired position in the `dialogPlacement` prop.

<Example Component={SpotlightDialogPlacement} packageName="@atlaskit/onboarding" />

## Dialog width

You can set a dialog width for a spotlight dialog with the `dialogWidth` prop. The minimum supported width is `160px`, and the maximum is `600px`.

<Example Component={SpotlightDialogWidth} packageName="@atlaskit/onboarding" />

## Target border radius

The border radius of the spotlight target needs to be explicitly set. In the example below, the first spotlight applies the default behavior, the second spotlight sets `targetRadius` to `3` to match a target button, and the final spotlight has `targetRadius` to `24` to match a round target.

<Example Component={SpotlightTargetRadius} packageName="@atlaskit/onboarding" />

## Target background color

Sometimes the blanket can affect the background color of the target element. For example, subtle buttons are semi-transparent, which causes them to look darker when the blanket is applied. In cases like this, you can pass a color value to `targetBgColor` to make your target stand out properly.

<Example Component={SpotlightTargetBackground} packageName="@atlaskit/onboarding" />

## Target replacement

You can replace the original target with another component using the `targetReplacement` prop.

<Example Component={SpotlightTargetReplacement} packageName="@atlaskit/onboarding" />

## Conditional spotlight targets

You can use the `useSpotlight` hook to check if a spotlight target is rendered or not. This allows you to conditionally add steps into a spotlight tour.

<Example Component={SpotlightConditionalTargets} packageName="@atlaskit/onboarding" />
