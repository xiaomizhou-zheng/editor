## Usage

A benefits modal focuses a user's attention on a large or impactful update (for information on how to size first impressions, see [user journey sizes](/patterns/first-impressions/user-journey-sizes/)). 

The modal can be followed by a [spotlight tour](/components/onboarding/usage) to highlight changes and benefits at the right time and place.

## Anatomy

![Benefits modal anatomy](images/benefits-modal-anatomy.png)

The benefits modal component is made up of the following:

- **Illustration:** Should relate to the content or benefit literally or metaphorically (see best practices below).
- **Title:** A primary heading (h600). The title provides a concise overview of the contents of the journey.
- **Message:** The contents of the dialog. See content guidelines below.
- **Actions:** Contains a maximum of two centered buttons: a primary action and some sort of dismiss button. 
<!-- The main action should be self-describing action verbs ('Get started' instead of 'OK'). -->
<!-- The above guidance seems to conflict with other guidance we have... maybe its OK since this is for the modal and not spotlight? -->
- **Blanket:** Covers the content underneath the modal, so that the focus is on the modal, and the content beneath is not accidentally selected.

## Best practices

- Make sure onboarding messages complement rather than compete with each other. Walk through the entire end-to-end journey that your new experience is a part of. This can help highlight where you may be repetitive or where steps may not be needed. Less is more.
- Try not to overwhelm users with too much information at once. Focus on the top two to three benefits and then gradually introduce changes over time.
- Offer a dismiss option at each point in the journey.
- Ask yourself if a modal is the right medium for this message - modals can be intrusive and should only be used for large-scale changes.

### Illustrations

- Make complex ideas more accessible
- Should be a spot hero image that relates to the UI copy
- Can efficiently convey brand personality
- Guide people in the right direction or let them know what to expect

## Content guidelines

### Titles

- Use the title to communicate the main benefit in an active and personalized way, for example: "Manage your issues", instead of "Issue types."
- Try to personalize where you can, for example: "A better experience for your team", instead of "Better team experiences."
- Try to limit titles to three words, although four words are permissible if you are using a short article like “an”, “a”, or “the”.

### Message copy

- Try to keep message length to less than three lines at the product's minimum supported size.
- Don't just point out what the feature or functionality is. Tell people why it's important at this point in time.
- Be considerate of people's time and patience. Be short and to the point, and avoid using company jargon.

## Accessibility

- Include copy with illustrations.
- Use alt text for meaningful illustrations.
