## Basic

A benefits modal can explain large or impactful updates. While `children` is the only required prop, all benefits modals should include a heading and actions.

We recommend including an illustration with all benefits modals. If you feel that the story isn't strong enough to require one, you might be better off using a [spotlight](/components/onboarding/examples) instead.
