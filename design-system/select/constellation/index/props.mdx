## Prop usage

### Controllable Props

`@atlaskit/single-select` and `@atlaskit/multi-select` had the concept of `stateful` and `stateless` components.
Where the exported `stateful` component, internally managed specific (in state) props available in the `stateless` component.
These props were:

- `selectedItem`
- `filterValue`
- `isOpen`

There's a lot of value in this idea, as it allows users to opt into controlling certain aspects of the select in one export while
being happy with default behavior in the `Stateless` version. However, what if I only want to control one of the three controllable props,
and want the package to internally manage the rest?
This was not possible in `@atlaskit/single-select` or `@atlaskit/multi-select`, if you opt into using the stateless component, you opt into being responsible for all of the prop values specified.

We've taken this concept and refined it in `@atlaskit/select`.
In `@atlaskit/select`, there are optional props you can use to control the state of the component:

- `value` controls the select value
- `inputValue` controls the search input value
- `menuIsOpen` controls whether the menu is open

You can use none, any, or all of these depending on your requirements.
The props have associated events that are called when the value should change. Here's an example implementation of all three:

```
<Select
  value={this.state.value}
  onChange={value => this.setState({ value })}
  inputValue={this.state.inputValue}
  onInputChange={inputValue => this.setState({ inputValue })}
  menuIsOpen={this.state.menuIsOpen}
  onMenuOpen={() => this.setState({ menuIsOpen: true })}
  onMenuClose={() => this.setState({ menuIsOpen: false })}
/>
```

If you don't use the controlled props, `@atlaskit/select` has props that let you default their value when it mounts:

```
<Select
  defaultValue={{ label: 'Default Option', value: 'default-value' }}
  defaultInputValue="Search Text"
  defaultMenuIsOpen={true}
/>
```

#### PopupSelect

The `PopupSelect` named export also provides additional props to control the state of the popup.

- `isOpen` controls whether the popup is open (controlled)
- `defaultIsOpen` controls whether the popup is initially open on mount (uncontrolled)

### Components API

In `single-select` and `multi-select`, we've had several issues opened as a result of users wanting to customize
the appearance or functionality of the exported `select` in various ways. `@atlaskit/select` opens up the API
to allow customization and configuration of any/every part of the select by exposing a new components prop.

For example, to render a custom Option component:

```
components={{
  Option: ({ children, innerProps }) => (
    <div className="custom-option" {...innerProps}>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}}
```

All components are passed a set of common props. The most important to understand are:

`children` - If the component should contain other components (for example, a menu contains options) they will be passed as children. This way you don't need to re-implement more than you absolutely need to.

`getStyles` - A function that will return an object containing the styles for the component. If you have specified custom style modifiers, they will be executed by this function.

`innerProps` - A set of props that should be spread onto the DOM element your component returns. It wires up accessibility attributes and events.

You don't have to use these props, and are free to implement or reimplement as you like - but they are intended to help make custom implementations easier to manage.

See the [Components Documentation](https://react-select.com/components) for more details and examples.

### Styles API

Each component that `@atlaskit/select` exposes also has a corresponding key that you can specify in the styles prop.
Each value you provide should be a function that takes the default styles, and returns your customized style object.

For example, to give the control a white background:

```
styles={{
  control: (base) => ({ ...base, backgroundColor: 'white' })
}}
```

See the [Styles Documentation](https://react-select.com/styles) for more details and examples.

### Custom data structure

`@atlaskit/select` enforces as little opinion about the shape of your options as possible. With the combination of custom components API, and the styling API,
your options can really take whatever shape you like. Of course by default, **assumptions** are made about how to render and filter options and values, however `@atlaskit/select` exposes
the following methods to allow you to configure this as you choose.

#### getOptionValue

The `getOptionValue` prop takes the following shape:

```
(option: OptionType) => string
```

The returned string value is what is internally used within `react-select` to validate the following:

- Which options are matched to a search term (`isSearchable`)
- Which options are already selected (`isMulti`)
- Which options are removed
- Which options are rendered in the hidden input field (if it's rendered)

#### getOptionLabel

The `getOptionLabel` prop takes the following shape:

```
(option) => string
```

The returned string value is the string that's rendered:

- As the label for options in the menu
- As the label for value(s) in the control.

Please use this if you only want to customize the label text that gets rendered for an option.

#### formatOptionLabel

The `formatOptionLabel` prop takes the following shape:

```
(option, { context, inputValue, selectedValue}) => Node
```

The returned Node is rendered as the label of the value/s rendered in the control.

#### isOptionDisabled

By default `@atlaskit/select` looks for a `isDisabled` property your passed in options. However as is the case with all the methods mentioned above, `@atlaskit/select` exposes a `isOptionDisabled` prop that allows you to override this inbuilt logic. This takes the following shape:

```
(option: OptionType) => boolean
```

#### isOptionSelected

Similar to `isOptionDisabled`, for a `select` instance with `isMulti` active, `@atlaskit/select` provides an `isOptionSelected` prop to validate whether or not an option is already a selected value, before it decide whether to select or deselect an option.

By default `@atlaskit/select` performs a reference equality check between the candidate option and the value objects within our internally maintained dictionary of selected values.

However if you pass in a function of the following shape:

```
(option: {[string]: any}, options Array<{[string]: any}>) => boolean
```

it will override the default logic specified.

#### Action Meta

The `onChange` and `onInputChange` props are now passed a second argument, which contains meta about why the event was called. For example:

```
onChange = (newValue, actionMeta) => console.log(actionMeta);
// possible values:
{
  removedValue?: ValueType,
  action: 'select-option'
    | 'deselect-option'
    | 'remove-value'
    | 'pop-value'
    | 'set-value'
    | 'clear'
    | 'create-option';
}
```

Additionally, the `removedValue` is conditionally added to the `ActionMeta`, if the action is of type `remove-value` or `pop-value`.

The new `onInputChange` prop also passes `actionMeta`:

```
onInputChange = (newValue, actionMeta) => console.log(actionMeta);
// possible values:
{
  action: 'set-value' | 'input-change' | 'input-blur' | 'menu-close';
}
```

### Custom filter

`@atlaskit/select` exposes a `filterOption` prop that allows you to configure how options in your select get filtered down by a search value.
This takes the following shape:

```
(option: OptionType, inputValue: string) => boolean
```

Additionally, `@atlaskit/select` also exports a `createFilter` closure which takes in a configuration object of the following shape:

```
{
  ignoreCase?: boolean,
  ignoreAccents?: boolean,
  stringify?: Object => string,
  trim?: boolean,
  matchFrom?: 'any' | 'start'
}
```

and returns a function of the shape expected by the `filterOption` prop. By default our `filterOption` prop value is the function returned from an invocation of the `createFilter` without a config object, the default config object used internally is as follows:

```
{
  ignoreCase: true,
  ignoreAccents: true,
  stringify: option => option.label + " " + option.value
  trim: true,
  matchFrom: 'any'
}
```

The goal here is to allow for varying levels of configuration of the core filtering logic used within a `select` instance. We recognize that you may not want to replace all of the filtering logic put have in place by default, and by invoking the `createFilter` export with your desired config, you should be able to pick and choose filtering decisions that best suit you, without having to rewrite the logic from scratch. If you _do_ want to do this however, supplying a `filterOption` function of the specified shape is always a viable option.

### Testing

Being able to programmatically test the behavior of your components is important.
`ak/select` enables this through two props `className` and `classNamePrefix`.

Typically when these two props are not defined, the dom-elements in `ak/select` use emotions generated classnames.
However with `className` and `classNamePrefix`, `ak/select` generates semantic classnames for you to reliably search for specific dom elements in the tree.

The value specified in the `className` prop is reflected down to the selects container.
While the value of the `classNamePrefix` prop is reflected down to every single dom element in the tree as a prefix.

You can see this by inspecting the following example.

<Example packageName="@atlaskit/select" Component={SingleSelect} />

Note here that the `className` of the container element has both the generated css as well as `single-select` the value of the `className` prop.
Every other element in the tree also includes the generated emotion `classname` as well as a semantic classname preceded by `react-select` the value passed into the `classNamePrefix`.

As such in our tests, we can now reliably assert the state of specific dom elements, like so:

```
  import { BrowserTestCase } from '@atlaskit/webdriver-runner/runner';
  import Page from '@atlaskit/webdriver-runner/wd-wrapper';
  const selectInputElement = '.react-select__input';

  BrowserTestCase('ak/select input should be identifiable by classname',
    {},
    async (client: any) => {
      const page = new Page(client);
      expect(await page.isVisible(selectInputElement)).toBe(true);
    }
  )
```

Once you provide a `classNamePrefix`, these are the selectors that will be exposed to you:

- [classNamePrefix]\_\_control
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_input
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_placeholder
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_value-container
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_indicators
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_dropdown-indicator
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_clear-indicator
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_menu
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_menu-list
- [classNamePrefix]\_\_option

Providing a value for the `className` prop will reflect that value to the class name of the `select` container.
