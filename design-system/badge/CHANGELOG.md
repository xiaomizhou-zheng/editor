### Major Changes

- [`942dd25df09`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/942dd25df09) - In this version we made **Badge** dramatically faster and lighter.

  - General performance improvements.

  - We are now exporting a new `style` prop which you can use to pass a custom `backgroundColor` and `color`.

  - You can now pass `ReactNode` instead of `string` as children; however, **Badge** should only be used in cases where you want to represent a number. If the value is `number`, we will use existing formatting based on the `max` prop, otherwise the value will get rendered as it is.

  - [**BREAKING**] We have removed the deprecated `theme` prop. Please use a combination of `appearance` and `style` prop for custom theming.

  **Before**:

  ```tsx
  import Badge from '@atlaskit/badge';

  type GetThemeTokensFn<ThemeTokens, ThemeProps> = (
    props: ThemeProps,
  ) => ThemeTokens;

  function themeGetterFunction<ThemeTokens, ThemeProps>(
    getTokens: GetThemeTokensFn<ThemeTokens, ThemeProps>,
    themeProps: ThemeProps,
  ): ThemeTokens {
    const defaultTokens = getTokens(themeProps);

    if (themeProps.appearance === 'removed') {
      return {
        ...defaultTokens,
        textColor: 'grey',
      };
    }

    return defaultTokens;
  }

  <Badge appearance="removed" theme={themeGetterFunction}>
    {10}
  </Badge>;
  ```

  **After**:

  ```tsx
  import Badge, { BadgeProps } from '@atlaskit/badge';

  function getStyle(appearance: BadgeProps['appearance']) {
    if (appearance === 'removed') {
      return {
        color: 'grey',
      };
    }

    return undefined;
  }

  const appearance = 'removed';

  <Badge appearance={appearance} style={getStyle(appearance)}>
    {10}
  </Badge>;
  ```

  - [**BREAKING**] We have removed `Container` and `Format` components. Please use a combination of `style` and `ReactNode` type `children` prop for customization.

  **Before**:

  ```tsx
  import { Container, Format } from '@atlaskit/badge';

  <Container backgroundColor="red" textColor="blue">
    <em>
      <Format>{10}</Format>
    </em>
  </Container>;
  ```

  **After**:

  ```tsx
  import Badge from '@atlaskit/badge';

  <Badge style={{ backgroundColor: 'red', color: 'blue' }}>
    <em>
      {10}
    </em>
  </Badge>

  // or if you are passing `max` prop so that formatting logic should work

  <em>
    <Badge style={{ backgroundColor: 'red', color: 'blue' }} max={5}>
      {10}
    </Badge>
  </em>
  ```

  - [**BREAKING**] We have removed the support of `appearance` prop object value. Please use `style` prop for customization.

  **Before**:

  ```tsx
  import Badge from '@atlaskit/badge';

  <Badge appearance={{ backgroundColor: 'red', textColor: 'blue' }}>
    {10}
  </Badge>;
  ```

  **After**:

  ```tsx
  import Badge from '@atlaskit/badge';

  <Badge style={{ backgroundColor: 'red', color: 'blue' }}>{10}</Badge>;
  ```

  **Running the codemod cli**

  To run the codemod: **You first need to have the latest version installed**

  ```bash

  yarn upgrade @atlaskit/badge@^15.0.0

  ```

  Once upgraded, use `@atlaskit/codemod-cli` via `npx`:

  ```bash

  npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli --parser babel --extensions ts,tsx,js [relativePath]

  ```

  The CLI will show a list of components and versions so select `@atlaskit/badge@^15.0.0` and you will automatically be upgraded.

  What will be changed:

  - It will move `backgroundColor` and `textColor` from `appearance` prop (if object is passed as `appearance` prop value) to `style` prop.

  Run `npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli -h` for more details on usage.

  For Atlassians,

  refer to the [documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/framework/atlassian-frontend/codemods/01-atlassian-codemods/) for more details on the codemod CLI.

  ### Dropping CJS support in all @atlaskit packages

  As a breaking change, all @atlaskit packages will be dropping cjs distributions and will only distribute esm. This means all distributed code will be transpiled, but will still contain `import` and
  `export` declarations.

  The major reason for doing this is to allow us to support multiple entry points in packages, e.g:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/colors`;
  ```

  Previously this was sort of possible for consumers by doing something like:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/dist/esm/colors`;
  ```

  This has a couple of issues. 1, it treats the file system as API making internal refactors harder, we have to worry about how consumers might be using things that aren't _actually_ supposed to be used. 2. We are unable to do this _internally_ in @atlaskit packages. This leads to lots of packages bundling all of theme, just to use a single color, especially in situations where tree shaking fails.

  To support being able to use multiple entrypoints internally, we unfortunately cannot have multiple distributions as they would need to have very different imports from of their own internal dependencies.

  ES Modules are widely supported by all modern bundlers and can be worked around in node environments.

  We may choose to revisit this solution in the future if we find any unintended condequences, but we see this as a pretty sane path forward which should lead to some major bundle size decreases, saner API's and simpler package architecture.

  Please reach out to #fabric-build (if in Atlassian) or create an issue in [Design System Support](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=24670) (for external) if you have any questions or queries about this.
