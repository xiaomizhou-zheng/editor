## Usage

Inline dialogs are displayed when triggered by a user action, usually by clicking a button.

## Anatomy

1. **Trigger:** Indicates what information the inline dialog will surface.
2. **Window:** Displayed when the trigger is selected.
3. **Controls:** Control items can include [buttons](/components/button), [checkboxes](/components/checkbox), and [text fields](/components/textfield).

## Best practices

- Inline dialogs should be used when sections within the page require further information or actions, but are not crucial to the page as a whole.
- Inline dialogs should be concise to get the point across as quickly as possible. This is a focused component, so only one dialog can be open at a time.
- A great use for inline dialogs is feature discovery.

## Content guidelines

Text in an inline dialog should be concise to get the point across as quickly as possible.

## Server

- Use [inline messages](/components/inline-message) to alert users that important information is available or an action is required to complete the current task.
- See [flags](/components/flag) for messages containing confirmations, alerts, and acknowledgments that require minimal user interaction.
- Use [modal dialogs](/components/modal-dialog) for more complex interactions and information.
