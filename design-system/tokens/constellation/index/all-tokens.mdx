    Expect frequent changes as we iterate over the coming months. 
    For early access and release updates, <a href="https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/introducing-design-tokens-new-colour-foundations-and-dark-mode/62258">see our developer community announcement</a>.
    For Atlassian employees, <a href="https://go.atlassian.com/tokens">see details</a>.
    <br/><br/>
    Design tokens use our new color palette and will not always match those imported from @atlaskit/theme/colors. For more information, see the <a href="/components/tokens/migration-guide#colors-are-changing">migration guide</a>.
