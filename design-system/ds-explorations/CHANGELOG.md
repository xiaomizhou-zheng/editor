# @atlaskit/ds-explorations

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`93d75a4e289`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/93d75a4e289) - Adding id prop for Text component so that element can be updated with id attribute. It's a way for an element to be uniquely identifiable for a range of reasons. For example: URL anchors, reference target for integrations and accessible label references.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`30c6ec5a76f`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/30c6ec5a76f) - **Breaking Change**

  The package has been moved to a v1 state. It is no less or more stable (see readme for more information) however this update is to ensure that the consumption of minor versions for the package in downstream dependencies is correctly resolved.

  This update also includes changes to the way the `Text` component behaves with `Box`:

  - Text will now remove redundant DOM elements if it detects that it is already in the context of a `Text` element. This will only occur if the Text element that is a candidate for removal does not apply any custom property.
  - Text will also try to apply a color that is accessible if no user choice has been provided and the background of the surface causes an accessibility failure.

### Minor Changes

- [`664d3fe6586`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/664d3fe6586) - Use spacing tokens for all spacing-related props. Remove old SPACING_SCALE and GlobalSpacingToken.
