## Usage

Custom icons should only be used in cases where no other hosted icon meets your required action. To search through all the icons we have in our system, have a look at our [icon explorer](/components/icon/icon-explorer).

## Best practices

### Constraints

Your custom icon needs to adhere to the following constraints.

- The root svg should be on a `0 0 24 24` view box
- The first child element should set `fill` to `currentColor` to inherit the `primaryColor` prop
- For icons with secondary colors set `fill` to `inherit` on the appropriate elements to inherit the `secondaryColor` prop
- Icons should be designed on a 20px grid and exported with padding on a 24px canvas.
- Build from foundational shapes: square, circle, or rectangles (horizontal or vertical).

### Style

#### Stroke caps

Using a round cap at the end a stroke adds a sense of openness and optimism to the icon. For this reason, use round caps unless you are trying to indicate icon depth, in that case, use a slice to create a butt cap.

#### Angles

When creating shapes like arrows or when you need more real estate, use angles that are 45 ̊ or 90 ̊. When more subtlety is required, use 30 ̊ or 60 ̊ angles.

#### Icon depth (butt cap)

A butt cap is used to create depth between two objects in an icon and should never be rounded or touch other elements in the icon. Keep 1px space between the butt and other elements.

Adding icon depth implies multiple or grouped items. Use icon depth to imply multiple or grouped items.

#### Radius

The radius is a key characteristic of Atlassian icons and adds consistency and personality. All square and rectangle shapes should use a 2px border radius depending on the size of the shape and minor radius' are 1px.

1. All squares and rectangles must have a 2px radius.
2. Irregularly shaped corners must be curved using a 1px radius.
3. Inner junctions should never have a radius unless the outer radius exceeds 2px.

#### Scale

When scaling down icons, smaller elements like circles should be solid to help with legibility.
