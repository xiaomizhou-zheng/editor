## Default

This is a way that you can provide a similar API to the `Icon` component, without needing to use one of the icons in our library and without bringing along the wrapping positional `span` that comes with the `Icon` component.

Some constraints to be aware of:
- `SVG` has a `24px` by `24px` view box which children should adhere to
- The first child element should set `fill` to `currentColor` to inherit the `primaryColor` prop
- For icons with secondary colors set `fill` to `inherit` on the appropriate elements to inherit the `secondaryColor` prop

<Example Component={CustomSVGDefault} packageName='@atlaskit/icon'/>
