## 12.0.0

### Major Changes

In this version, we made `Checkbox` dramatically faster and more lightweight üòç

### Changes

In `12.0.0` we improved the performance of `Checkbox` by making it more similar to a native checkbox and removing performance-heavy API.

### Overrides

`overrides` is an API that allowed extreme customisation flexibility. Previously you could customise the css and attributes of 6 internal components or replace the component entirely.

```
<Checkbox
  overrides={{
    IconWrapper: {
      cssFn: defaultStyles => {
        ...defaultStyles,
        transition: 'all 0.3 cubic-bezier',
      },
      component: SomeCustomComponent,
      attributes: { 'data-custom': true }
    }
  }}
/>
```

This proved to be a significant performance problem even if you weren't using the API. It also exposes internal structure as external API which prevents us from changing the structure and improving the component. We found that not many consumers were using `overrides` so we decided to benefit all consumers of `Checkbox` we have removed `overrides` from the package. If you are using `overrides` and we haven't already been in contact with you, contact the design system team for assistance in migrating away from it.

### Theming

`theme` is another API that allows you to customise the appearance of `Checkbox`. Theming could previously be used to customise the various colours, spacing and sizes used in `Checkbox`. Much like `overrides` there was minimal usage of this API and it was identified to have a negative performance impact regardless of whether it was used.

We decided to also remove this API to benefit all consumers of `Checkbox`. If you would like to continue customising checkbox there are now two ways of doing this. `Checkbox` now spreads any `HTMLInputAttribute` onto the checkbox input. Therefore you can put a `className` on the checkbox input and target the svg that is actually being shown, in the exact same way that we target the svg based off checkbox styles. For example,

```
import React from 'react';
import { css } from '@emotion/core';
import { Checkbox } from '@atlaskit/checkbox;

export default function CustomStyleExample() {
  return (
    <Checkbox
      label="Custom style checkbox"
      css={css`
        & + svg {
          margin-left: -2px;
        }
      `}
    />
  )
}
```

You can also customise the size of the `Checkbox` with the size prop.

```
import React from 'react';

import { Checkbox } from '@atlaskit/Checkbox';

export default function LargeSizeExample() {
  return (
    <Checkbox
      defaultChecked
      value="Large checkbox"
      label="Large checkbox"
      name="checkbox-basic"
      size="large"
      testId="large"
    />
  );
}

```

Note that `Checkbox` still supports the light mode / dark mode global token. Along with this change we have removed the exports `ComponentTokens` and `ThemeFn` from `Checkbox` as they can no longer be used with the removal of `theme`.

### Other changes

- Previously all interaction styles were generated in JS using events, causing unnecessary and slow rerenders for actions like hovering and focusing. Now all styles for the `Checkbox` are applied using css selectors.
- To generate less dom elements we have removed the dependency on `@atlaskit/icon` and instead changed to an `svg` that can be customised to be the default checkbox or the indeterminate checkbox. This `svg` is styled from the input element with the sibling selector.
- The disabled state of `Checkbox` previously had no border. This was not intentional and now `Checkbox` has a 2px border when it is disabled, this is consistent with all other states of `Checkbox`.
- `CheckboxProps` now extends `HTMLInputAttribute` which means you can pass any input attribute as a prop onto `Checkbox`.
- Changed the `inputRef` prop to be `ref` which returns the `ref` of the checkbox input using `forwardRef`. This new `ref` prop will accept the type of the old `inputRef` prop, `(input?: HTMLInputElement) => any`, as well as if `ref` is created with `createRef`.
- Removed the prop `isFullWidth` as it did not do anything.
- Updated the entry point to only export `Checkbox` and `CheckboxProps`. `Checkbox` can now be a named or default import. As the old entry point allowed access to every export at the base level these exports have now been removed; `ComponentTokens`, `ThemeFn`, `CheckboxWithoutAnalytics`, `CheckboxIcon` as well as all exported types.
- Changed indeterminate checkboxes to set `aria-checked` to be `mixed`.

### Automatic upgrading

There is a codemod that assists you in upgrading most of the changes from above.

- Removes `isFullWidth`, `theme` and `overrides` prop.
- Shifts over usages of `inputRef` to `ref`
- Removes imports of `ComponentTokens` and `ThemeFn`.
- Changes imports of `CheckboxProps` to be at the base level.
- Changes imports of `CheckboxWithoutAnalytics` to import `Checkbox` at the base level.

```
# You first need to have the latest `Checkbox` installed before you can run the codemod
yarn upgrade @atlaskit/checkbox@^12.0.0

# Run the codemod cli
# Pass in a parser for your codebase
npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli /path/to/target/directory --parser [tsx | flow | babel]
```

### Patch Changes

- [`c7604cdf02`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/c7604cdf02) - In `12.0.0` the `checkbox` input accidentally changed vertical alignment from `top` to `center`. This had a visual impact when you had a checkbox label the spanned multiple lines. This changes the vertical alignment of the `checkbox` input back to `top`.
- [`6cb7f0c5e5`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/6cb7f0c5e5) - Patch fix to make the svg not shrink and give Checkbox a display name.

  Theme has been converted to Typescript. Typescript consumers will now get static type safety. Flow types are no longer provided.

  ### Breaking

  ** getTokens props changes **
  When defining the value function passed into a ThemeProvider, the getTokens parameter cannot be called without props; if no props are provided an empty object `{}` must be passed in:

  ```javascript
  <CustomTheme.Provider
    value={t => ({ ...t(), backgroundColor: '#333'})}
  >
  ```

  becomes:

  ```javascript
  <CustomTheme.Provider
    value={t => ({ ...t({}), backgroundColor: '#333'})}
  >
  ```

  ** Color palette changes **
  Color palettes have been moved into their own file.
  Users will need to update imports from this:

  ```javascript
  import { colors } from '@atlaskit/theme';

  colors.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  to this:

  ```javascript
  import { colorPalette } from '@atlaskit/theme';

  colorPalette.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  or for multi entry-point users:

  ```javascript
  import * as colors from '@atlaskit/theme/colors';

  colors.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  to this:

  ```javascript
  import * as colorPalettes from '@atlaskit/theme/color-palette';

  colorPalettes.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  Adding an optional prop `testId` that will set the attribute value `data-testid`. It will help products to write better integration and end to end tests.

## 10.0.0

### Major Changes

- [major][97bab7fd28](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/97bab7fd28):

  `@atlaskit/checkbox` **10.x** includes the following changes:

  - Replaced previous theme implementation with new `@atlaskit/theme` v2 implementation
    - Please read more about this implementation in the [theming guide](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/core/theme/docs/theming-guide)
  - Added `overrides` prop which enables targeted customisations of key components in the @atlaskit/checkbox package.
    - Please read more about this implementation in the [overrides guide](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/core/theme/docs/overrides-guide)

  ### Breaking Changes

  **HiddenCheckbox and spread props**

  Passing props to the `<Checkbox/>` component for them to be spread onto the underlying `<HiddenCheckbox/>` component is now **no longer possible**.
  `@atlaskit/checkbox` still supports passing props down to the `<HiddenCheckbox/>` component, however we've opted to make this behaviour more explicit.

  Whereas previously you would do this:

  ```js
  <Checkbox
    ...supportedCheckboxProps
    'data-testid'='test-checkbox'
  />
  ```

  Now you would leverage the overrides prop to pass these props down to the `<HiddenCheckbox/>` component like so:

  ```js
  <Checkbox
    ...supportedCheckboxProps
    overrides={{
      HiddenCheckbox:{
        attributesFn: () => ({ 'data-testid': 'test-checkbox' })
      }
    }}
  />
  ```

  - Drop ES5 from all the flow modules

  ### Dropping CJS support in all @atlaskit packages

  As a breaking change, all @atlaskit packages will be dropping cjs distributions and will only distribute esm. This means all distributed code will be transpiled, but will still contain `import` and
  `export` declarations.

  The major reason for doing this is to allow us to support multiple entry points in packages, e.g:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/colors`;
  ```

  Previously this was sort of possible for consumers by doing something like:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/dist/esm/colors`;
  ```

  This has a couple of issues. 1, it treats the file system as API making internal refactors harder, we have to worry about how consumers might be using things that aren't _actually_ supposed to be used. 2. We are unable to do this _internally_ in @atlaskit packages. This leads to lots of packages bundling all of theme, just to use a single color, especially in situations where tree shaking fails.

  To support being able to use multiple entrypoints internally, we unfortunately cannot have multiple distributions as they would need to have very different imports from of their own internal dependencies.

  ES Modules are widely supported by all modern bundlers and can be worked around in node environments.

  We may choose to revisit this solution in the future if we find any unintended condequences, but we see this as a pretty sane path forward which should lead to some major bundle size decreases, saner API's and simpler package architecture.

  Please reach out to #fabric-build (if in Atlassian) or create an issue in [Design System Support](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=24670) (for external) if you have any questions or queries about this.

## 5.0.0

- [major] Checkbox refactored to remove the need for CheckboxStateless [80e1925](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/80e1925)

  `@atlaskit/checkbox` 5.x is part of an ongoing body of work to normalize atlaskit form components.
  There are a few breaking changes you need to be aware of in upgrading from 4.x to 5.x.

  **Exports**

  `@atlaskit/checkbox` no longer specifies the Checkbox component as the default export.
  Moreover the following changes have been made to exports from the `@atlaskit/checkbox` package.

  ### Checkbox

  Checkbox is now a named export of the `@atlaskit/checkbox`package. Please import it as below.

  ```
  import { Checkbox } from @atlaskit/checkbox;
  ```

  The Checkbox component is now a conditionally controlled component, the `isChecked` prop is exposed for users to control the checked state of the component.
  This was the sole reason for having the `CheckboxStateless` component in pre 5.x, and as a result leveraging this pattern allows us to do away with the `CheckboxStateless` component.

  To let the component take care of checked state, leave the `isChecked` prop unset, or explicitly set it to undefined.

  Additionally, one can control the initial checked state of a component by setting the `defaultChecked` (boolean) prop.
  This is used as the initial value of the internal `isChecked` property in state. This value will be overridden by additional user interactions with the component.

  ### CheckboxStateless - deprecated

  This component has been deprecated in favor of the conditionally controlled component pattern specified above.\*\*

  ### CheckboxGroup - deprecated:

  `@atlaskit/checkbox` no longer exports a CheckboxGroup component. It has been removed for the following reasons:

  - It was really a thin wrapper enforcing very basic styling opinions over its children (display: flex, flex: column).
  - The existing styling blocks the horizontal display of checkbox group children.

  **Prop Changes**

  - `<Checkbox/>` - `initiallyChecked` renamed to `defaultChecked`
  - `<Checkbox/>` - `label` prop now accepts type Node instead of type string.
  - `<Checkbox/>` - `isChecked` is now an optional boolean prop on the Checkbox component.
