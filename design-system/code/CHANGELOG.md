## 14.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`e8f66c36dd7`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/e8f66c36dd7) - **BREAKING CHANGES**

  This version includes several breaking changes to improve performance of the `@atlaskit/code` package.

  `<Code />` no longer supports syntax highlighting, greatly simplifying the component. Additionally, the `text` prop has been removed in favour of using `children` directly. This allows users to provide complex nodes (not just plain text) to Code.

  ```jsx
  // previous
  <Code text="const x = 10;" language="js" />
  // now with language no longer supported
  <Code>const x = 10;</Code>
  ```

  Component theming is no longer supported in `<Code />` or `<CodeBlock />`; this change does not effect global theming. As an escape hatch, two CSS variables are exposed:

  - `--ds--code--line-number-bg-color`: which controls the background color of the line numbers if set
  - `--ds--code--bg-color`: which controls the background color of the block body if set

  Components can now be imported individually using individual entrypoints. Using these entrypoints will reduce the overall bundle size of this package if you do not need both components.

  ```js
  import { Code } from '@atlaskit/code';
  // --> to
  import Code from '@atlaskit/code/inline';

  import { CodeBlock } from '@atlaskit/code';
  // --> to
  import CodeBlock from '@atlaskit/code/block';

  // note this will still work
  import { Code, CodeBlock } from '@atlaskit/code';
  ```

  Finally, `CodeBlock` has had type improvements, and internal optimisations to facilitate faster rendering and updates.

- [`7e091c1d415`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/7e091c1d415) - BREAKING CHANGE:

  The `codeStyle` prop has now been removed on the `Code` component.

  For reference, previously this type of usage would effect the styling of any numbers in the code text.

  ```js
  <Code codeStyle={{ number: 'red' }} text={someCode} />
  ```

  Due to internal changes the above usage is no longer possible.

  This release also includes internal changes to the syntax highlighting element to use class names instead of inline styles for syntax highlighting. This results in a substantial performance gain.

### Minor Changes

- [`07e012bfc5b`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/07e012bfc5b) - Updates to internal package structure, exposing additional entrypoints. Types also tightened for language support to better match underlying component.

### Patch Changes

- [`b46ca884bc8`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/b46ca884bc8) - Add a codemod to remove usages of the `language` prop and convert the `text` prop to be a child.
- Updated dependencies

## 13.2.3

## 13.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`3c7be954dbd`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/3c7be954dbd) - [ux] Line highlighting now meets WCAG 2.1 guidelines. Colors that were failing contrast have been updated and there is now a new visual cue consisting of a left border to the highlighted lines.
- [`23ef692842a`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/23ef692842a) - [ux] `Code` and `CodeBlock` now use react-syntax-highlighter@^15 to highlight code. As part of this change
  the fontSize for the line numbers and the code body have been normalised. This will be a breaking visual change for all consumers.
  No action is required other than a callout that this will affect any existing visual regression tests.

  Users can now use the `themeOverride` prop to customise the application of the default theme. This is an escape hatch
  which will likley be removed in a future major version.

  This change also includes:

  - A bugfix for lineHeight that meant linenumbers and code body were not vertically aligned correctly.
  - A bugfix for the SSR'd components not rendering consistently before hydration
  - Improved semantic lines, which can now be properly consumed by screen readers.
  - The `Code` and `CodeBlock` now expose additional options in their `theme` prop. These are `codeFontSize` and `codeLineHeight`
    which allow customisation of the component's rendered font size.

- [`7c2f2056ef7`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/7c2f2056ef7) - [ux] Added code syntax highlighting for the following languages: AppleScript, Clojure, Delphi, Diff, FoxPro, Object Pascal, QML, Standard ML, Visual Basic, JSX and TSX

### Patch Changes

## 11.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [minor][9648afc5be](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/9648afc5be):

  Adds `highlight` prop to `AkCodeBlock`, `Example`, and the `code` template literal.
  Use this to emphasize which lines of code you would like people to look at!

  The `highlight` prop can be used as follows:

  - To highlight one line:
    `highlight="3"`
  - To highlight sequential lines:
    `highlight="1-5"`
  - To highlight sequential and multiple single lines:
    `highlight="1-5,7,10,15-20"`

  **`AkCodeBlock` component**

  Use the `highlight` prop.

  ```js
  import { AkCodeBlock } from '@atlaskit/code';

  <AkCodeBlock
    highlight="1-2"
    text={`
  <div>
    hello there
    <span>buds</span>
  </div>
    `}
  />;
  ```

  **`Example` component**

  Use the `highlight` prop.

  ```js
  import { Example } from '@atlaskit/docs';

  <Example
    packageName="@atlaskit/code"
    Component={require('../examples/00-inline-code-basic').default}
    title="Basic"
    highlight="19,24,30,36"
    source={require('!!raw-loader!../examples/00-inline-code-basic')}
  />;
  ```

  **`code` template literal**

  Add `highlight=` to the top of your code snippet.
  It takes the same values as the `highlight` prop.

  ```js
  import { code } from '@atlaskit/docs';

  code`highlight=5-7
    import React from 'react';
  
    () => (
      <div>
        hello there
        <span>buds</span>
      </div>
  )`;
  ```

  - Drop ES5 from all the flow modules

  ### Dropping CJS support in all @atlaskit packages

  As a breaking change, all @atlaskit packages will be dropping cjs distributions and will only distribute esm. This means all distributed code will be transpiled, but will still contain `import` and
  `export` declarations.

  The major reason for doing this is to allow us to support multiple entry points in packages, e.g:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/colors`;
  ```

  Previously this was sort of possible for consumers by doing something like:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/dist/esm/colors`;
  ```

  This has a couple of issues. 1, it treats the file system as API making internal refactors harder, we have to worry about how consumers might be using things that aren't _actually_ supposed to be used. 2. We are unable to do this _internally_ in @atlaskit packages. This leads to lots of packages bundling all of theme, just to use a single color, especially in situations where tree shaking fails.

  To support being able to use multiple entrypoints internally, we unfortunately cannot have multiple distributions as they would need to have very different imports from of their own internal dependencies.

  ES Modules are widely supported by all modern bundlers and can be worked around in node environments.

  We may choose to revisit this solution in the future if we find any unintended condequences, but we see this as a pretty sane path forward which should lead to some major bundle size decreases, saner API's and simpler package architecture.

  Please reach out to #fabric-build (if in Atlassian) or create an issue in [Design System Support](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=24670) (for external) if you have any questions or queries about this.
