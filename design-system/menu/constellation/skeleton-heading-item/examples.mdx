## Default

Renders a skeleton loading element the same size as the heading item. This is useful when you're asynchronously loading data for a menu, it has not yet loaded, and you are quite certain you know what the data will look like after it has loaded.

<Example Component={SkeletonHeadingItemDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/menu" />
