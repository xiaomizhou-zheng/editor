## Default

Renders a skeleton element that has the same sizing as an item. Useful when you're asynchronously loading data for a menu, if it has not yet loaded, and you are quite certain you know what the data will look like after it has loaded.

<Example Component={SkeletonItemDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/menu" />
