## Default

Sections are used to group related items in a menu, with an optional heading component. Generally you'll want to always group items in sections, even if there is only one item in the group; however a heading is not always necessary.

<Example Component={SectionDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/menu" />

## Scrollable

Sections constrained by height will become scrollable if the `isScrollable` prop is supplied.

<Example Component={SectionScrollable} packageName="@atlaskit/menu" />
