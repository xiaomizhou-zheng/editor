## Default

`MenuGroup` is one of the two available group components. This menu is designed to be placed inline inside of navigation elements.

If composing your menu as a popup, you'll want to use [PopupMenuGroup](/components/menu/popup-menu-group/examples), which constrains its width to predefined values.

<Example Component={MenuDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/menu" />
