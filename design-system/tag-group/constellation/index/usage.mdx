## Usage

Tag groups lay out and align a collection of related [tags](/components/tag/).

## Best practices

In almost every situation, the collection of tags inside a tag group should be a consistent type of tag. To avoid creating a confusing user experience, don't mix and match removable tags with non-removable tags or have only some tags act as links.
