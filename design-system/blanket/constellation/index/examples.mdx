## Default

A blanket overlays the rest of the page with a transparent grey when used with a modal or popup.

An `onBlanketClicked` prop is provided to catch clicks elsewhere on the page other than the modal or popup. Blanket does not have its own show/hide functionality, as it should be controlled with its parent element.

<Example Component={BlanketBasic} packageName="@atlaskit/blanket"/>

## Clickthrough

With the `shouldAllowClickThrough` prop enabled, `onBlanketClicked` does not get called and the elements underneath the blanket can be interacted with directly.

<Example Component={BlanketClickthrough} packageName="@atlaskit/blanket"/>

## Children

A blanket with children will exclude the children from being tinted by the blanket.

This example should be opened in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/atlaskit-blanket-03-blanket-with-children-forked-3ufhkb?file=/example.tsx) for a full-page experience.

<Example Component={BlanketWithChildren} showcaseVisible={false} packageName="@atlaskit/blanket"/>
