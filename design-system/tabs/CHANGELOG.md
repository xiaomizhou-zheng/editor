### Major Changes

- [`c17fe6144f8`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/c17fe6144f8) - ### Major Changes

  In this version, `Tabs` has had a pretty substantial rewrite. As well as now being dramatically faster and more lightweight, it has a brand new flexible composable API and a bunch of accessibility improvements.

  ### Composable API

  The old version of `Tabs` had a `tabs` prop that would map to `TabItem`'s and `TabContent`'s.

  ```
  import Tabs from '@atlaskit/tabs';

  const ComponentUsingTabs = () => (
    <Tabs tabs={
      { label: 'Tab 1', content: 'One' },
      { label: 'Tab 2', content: 'Two' },
      { label: 'Tab 3', content: 'Three' },
    ]} />
  );
  ```

  We've changed the language to match the W3 spec so a `TabItem` is now a `Tab` and a `TabContent` is a `TabPanel`. We now export these components as well as a `TabList` so consumers use a composable API that matches the DOM structure.

  ```
  import Tabs, { Tab, TabList, TabPanel } from '@atlaskit/tabs';

  const ComponentUsingTabs = () => (
    <Tabs
      id="component-using-tabs"
    >
      <TabList>
        <Tab>Tab 1</Tab>
        <Tab>Tab 2</Tab>
        <Tab>Tab 3</Tab>
      </TabList>
      <TabPanel>
        One
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel>
        Two
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel>
        Three
      </TabPanel>
    </Tabs>
  );
  ```

  This allows you to easily customise your usage, for example if you want to add a tooltip.

  ```
  import Tabs, { Tab, TabList, TabPanel } from '@atlaskit/tabs';
  import Tooltip from '@atlaskit/tooltip';

  const TooltipTab = ({ label, tooltip }: { label: string; tooltip: string }) => (
    <Tooltip content={tooltip}>
      <Tab>{label}</Tab>
    </Tooltip>
  );

  const ComponentUsingTabs = () => (
    <Tabs
      id="component-using-tabs"
    >
      <TabList>
        <TooltipTab label="Tab 1" tooltip="Tooltip for tab 1" />
        <TooltipTab label="Tab 2" tooltip="Tooltip for tab 2" />
        <TooltipTab label="Tab 3" tooltip="Tooltip for tab 3" />
      </TabList>
      <TabPanel>
        One
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel>
        Two
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel>
        Three
      </TabPanel>
    </Tabs>
  );
  ```

  ### Hooks replacing Component prop

  The `component` prop allowed you to customise the `Tab` and `TabPanel`. This approach seemed counter-intuitive and had a performance impact regardless of whether you were using it. Instead with composability we have have added two hooks, `useTab` and `useTabPanel`.

  To create a custom `Tab`, call `useTab` and spread those attributes onto the custom tab. From there you can use it in place of a `Tab`. For example if you want to change the font size you would do so like this.

  ```
  import { useTab } from '@atlaskit/tabs';

  const CustomTab = ({ label }: { label: string }) => {
    const tabAttributes = useTab();

    return (
      <div
        css={css`
          font-size: 16px;
        `}
        {...tabAttributes}
      >
        {label}
      </div>
    );
  };
  ```

  Likewise, to create a custom `TabPanel`, call `useTabPanel` and spread those attributes onto the custom tab panel.

  ```
  import { useTabPanel } from '@atlaskit/tabs';

  const CustomTabPanel = ({ body }: { body: string }) => {
    const tabPanelAttributes = useTabPanel();

    return (
      <div
        css={css`
          margin: 12px;
        `}
        {...tabPanelAttributes}
      >
        {body}
      </div>
    );
  };
  ```

  ### onSelect -> onChange

  The `onSelect` prop has been renamed to `onChange` to be consistent with other design system components. Internal state has now changed to keep track of the selected index. Previously the object in the `tabs` prop array of type `TabData` was passed as well as the index. If you were using this object you will have to change to use the index.

  The type has changed from
  `(selected: TabData, selectedIndex: number, analyticsEvent: UIAnalyticsEvent) => void;`
  to
  `(index: number, analyticsEvent: UIAnalyticsEvent) => void;`

  This also means if you are using the `selected` prop you will have to ensure you are using the index of the selected tab instead of the object of type `TabData`.

  ### isSelectedTest

  Previously you could provide the prop `isSelectedTest` to `Tabs` and it would determine what tab is selected by seeing what tab returns true when `isSelectedTest` is called. This is a messy API that effectively means there were two ways of making `Tabs` controlled. If you are using `isSelectedTest` you should swap to using the `selected` prop to indicate that a tab is selected.

  ### Accessibility and required ID

  According to the w3 spec each tab should be linked to its corresponding tab panel. We have added the `aria-controls` attribute to tabs and the `aria-labelledby` attribute to tab panels. In order to do this we needed to generate a unique id for each tab and tab panel. To ensure these id's are unique if there are multiple `Tabs` components on the same page there is now a required `id` prop.

  ### shouldUnmountTabPanelOnChange

  There was previously a prop `isContentPersisted` which defaults to false. When true it would render all tab panels. The new default behaviour of `Tabs` is to leave each tab panel mounted on the page after it has been selected. This means that tab panels will only mount if selected and will not unmount and remount when changing tabs. In light of this change, `isContentPersisted` has been removed and `shouldUnmountTabPanelOnChange` has been introduced. It defaults to false and if it is set to true it will unmount a `TabPanel` when it is not selected. Effectively `shouldUnmountTabPanelOnChange` is the inverse of `isContentPersisted`.

  ### Other changes

  - Remove `TabItem` and `TabContent` export.
  - Remove the types: `TabItemElementProps`, `TabItemComponentProvided`, `TabContentComponentProvided`, `TabItemType`, `TabContentType`, `SelectedProp`, `IsSelectedTestFunction`, `OnSelectCallback`, `TabsState`, `TabsNavigationProps` and `Mode`.

  ### Automatic upgrading

  There is a codemod that assists you in upgrading most of the changes from above.
  Depending on your usage, you will most likely have to do a manual step as this is a fairly big change in API. The codemod will do its best job at making sure everything functions but you may want to clean up your usage of `@atlaskit/tabs`. It does these following changes:

  - Adds a randomly generated ID
  - Changes `onSelect` to `onChange` and defines a new inline function that will functionally work the same as it used to. It is however a messy solution and you may want to change the function to only use the selected index.
  - Remove the `TabItem` and `TabContent` imports.
  - Map the array you supplied as a `tabs` prop to create `Tab`'s and `TabPanel`'s.
  - Remove the `component` and `isSelectedTest` prop.
  - Removes types that no longer exist.
  - Migrates your usage of `isContentPersisted` to one of `shouldUnmountTabPanelOnChange`.

  To run the codemod: **You first need to have the latest version installed**

  ```bash
  yarn upgrade @atlaskit/tabs@^13.0.0
  ```

  Once upgraded,
  use `@atlaskit/codemod-cli`:

  ```bash
  npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli --parser babel --extensions ts,tsx,js [relativePath]
  ```

  The CLI will show a list of components and versions so select `@atlaskit/tabs@^13.0.0` and you will automatically be upgraded.

  Run `npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli -h` for more details on usage.
  For Atlassians,
  refer to the [documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/framework/atlassian-frontend/codemods/01-atlassian-codemods/) for more details on the codemod CLI.

  ### Breaking

  ** getTokens props changes **
  When defining the value function passed into a ThemeProvider, the getTokens parameter cannot be called without props; if no props are provided an empty object `{}` must be passed in:

  ```javascript
  <CustomTheme.Provider
    value={t => ({ ...t(), backgroundColor: '#333'})}
  >
  ```

  becomes:

  ```javascript
  <CustomTheme.Provider
    value={t => ({ ...t({}), backgroundColor: '#333'})}
  >
  ```

  ** Color palette changes **
  Color palettes have been moved into their own file.
  Users will need to update imports from this:

  ```javascript
  import { colors } from '@atlaskit/theme';

  colors.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  to this:

  ```javascript
  import { colorPalette } from '@atlaskit/theme';

  colorPalette.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  or for multi entry-point users:

  ```javascript
  import * as colors from '@atlaskit/theme/colors';

  colors.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  to this:

  ```javascript
  import * as colorPalettes from '@atlaskit/theme/color-palette';

  colorPalettes.colorPalette('8');
  ```

### Patch Changes

- [patch][d0db01b410](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/d0db01b410):

  TypeScript users of withAnalyticsEvents and withAnalyticsContext are now required to provide props as a generic type. This is so that TypeScript can correctly calculate the props and defaultProps of the returned component.

  Before:

  ```typescript
  withAnalyticsEvents()(Button) as ComponentClass<Props>;
  ```

  After:

  ```typescript
  withAnalyticsEvents<Props>()(Button);
  ```

- [major][76299208e6](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/76299208e6):

  - Drop ES5 from all the flow modules

  ### Dropping CJS support in all @atlaskit packages

  As a breaking change, all @atlaskit packages will be dropping cjs distributions and will only distribute esm. This means all distributed code will be transpiled, but will still contain `import` and
  `export` declarations.

  The major reason for doing this is to allow us to support multiple entry points in packages, e.g:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/colors`;
  ```

  Previously this was sort of possible for consumers by doing something like:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/dist/esm/colors`;
  ```

  This has a couple of issues. 1, it treats the file system as API making internal refactors harder, we have to worry about how consumers might be using things that aren't _actually_ supposed to be used. 2. We are unable to do this _internally_ in @atlaskit packages. This leads to lots of packages bundling all of theme, just to use a single color, especially in situations where tree shaking fails.

  To support being able to use multiple entrypoints internally, we unfortunately cannot have multiple distributions as they would need to have very different imports from of their own internal dependencies.

  ES Modules are widely supported by all modern bundlers and can be worked around in node environments.

  We may choose to revisit this solution in the future if we find any unintended condequences, but we see this as a pretty sane path forward which should lead to some major bundle size decreases, saner API's and simpler package architecture.

  Please reach out to #fabric-build (if in Atlassian) or create an issue in [Design System Support](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=24670) (for external) if you have any questions or queries about this.

- [patch] fix tabs so that it re-renders when content props update [9b039dd](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/9b039dd)

## 5.0.0

- [major] Re-write tabs to provide a more flexible API. Breaking changes: 1) The package no longer exports TabsStateless. The Tabs component manages its own state by default, but will behave as a controlled component if the selectedTab prop is set. 2) The component no longer recognises the defaultSelected property on individual tab objects. Tabs now takes a defaultSelectedTab prop which accepts either a tab object or tab index. 3) The tabs prop is now required - the component will not render if this prop is not set. 4) It is no longer possible to render Tabs without a tab being selected. If the defaultSelectedTab and selectedTab props are not set the first tab will be selected by default. [10a5a5a](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/10a5a5a)
