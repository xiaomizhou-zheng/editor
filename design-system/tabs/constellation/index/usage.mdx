## Usage

Tabs are an easy way to organize content by grouping similar information on the same page. This allows content to be viewed without having to navigate away from that page.

## Anatomy

1. **Selected:** The active tab.
2. **Unselected:** The other available tabs.
3. **Divider:** Separates the tab navigation and content.

## Behavior

Tab behavior during standard, focus, hover, and active states are important because it lets users know where they are in the experience.

1. **Standard:** The default view.
2. **Focus:** Keyboard focus on a tab.
3. **Hover:** Hovering over a tab.
4. **Active:** Indicates the page that the user is viewing.

## Content guidelines

Tab labels provide clear and concise explanations of the content within. Each tab's content is independently categorized and mutually exclusive of the content of other tabs.
