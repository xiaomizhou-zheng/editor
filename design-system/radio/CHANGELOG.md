## 5.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`44ef6437cd`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/44ef6437cd) - In this version, we made radio dramatically faster and lighter üòç

  ### Changes

  In `5.0.0` we improved the performance of radio by making it more similar to a native radio input.

  - Previously we rendered a hidden input and an svg for the radio icon. This way we could get all the accessibility benefits of using a native radio input while being able to style the svg. We now use `appearance: none` on the input, enabling us to style the input and the `after` pseudo-element. This removes the need for an svg.
  - Previously all interaction styles were generated in JS using events, causing unnecessary and slow rerenders. Now all styles for the radio are applied using css selectors.
  - Because the input is now visible, we have changed the test id from `${testId}--hidden-radio` to `${testId}--radio-input` to provide less usage friction. We looked into product usage of the `testId` and we have reached out to the owners of any code that would be effected (there was only one).
  - Dropped the `peerDependency` on `styled-components@3` in favour of using `@emotion/core`.
  - Converted to function components.
  - Added the ability to forward a `ref` to a radio input.
  - Remove the `RadioIcon` export, you should just use the `Radio` without a label if you want this functionality.
  - Restricted types for `Radio` and `RadioGroup`. `RadioGroup` previously allowed you to pass any props so this has been restricted to only those used. The `isChecked` prop in the`options` prop for `RadioGroup` has been removed. You can only set a `Radio` as checked if the value of the `Radio` is the selected value in the `RadioGroup`. `Radio` used to explicitly define input attributes as props and now it extends `InputHTMLAttributes` allowing you to pass any input attribute as a prop.
  - There was a bug where all `onMouse` events were passed onto both the input element and the `Radio`, which means they would be called multiple times. Now they are only passed to the input element.
  - As `Radio` acts as a native radio input, the `name` prop on each `RadioGroup` needs to be unique or each `RadioGroup` with the same name needs to be inside a form element. This is because the `name` attribute on radio inputs is used to link the inputs so if you have two separate `RadioGroup`'s with the same name, the browser views them as one radio group.

  Theme has been converted to Typescript. Typescript consumers will now get static type safety. Flow types are no longer provided.

  ### Breaking

  ** getTokens props changes **
  When defining the value function passed into a ThemeProvider, the getTokens parameter cannot be called without props; if no props are provided an empty object `{}` must be passed in:

  ```javascript
  <CustomTheme.Provider
    value={t => ({ ...t(), backgroundColor: '#333'})}
  >
  ```

  becomes:

  ```javascript
  <CustomTheme.Provider
    value={t => ({ ...t({}), backgroundColor: '#333'})}
  >
  ```

  ** Color palette changes **
  Color palettes have been moved into their own file.
  Users will need to update imports from this:

  ```javascript
  import { colors } from '@atlaskit/theme';

  colors.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  to this:

  ```javascript
  import { colorPalette } from '@atlaskit/theme';

  colorPalette.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  or for multi entry-point users:

  ```javascript
  import * as colors from '@atlaskit/theme/colors';

  colors.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  to this:

  ```javascript
  import * as colorPalettes from '@atlaskit/theme/color-palette';

  colorPalettes.colorPalette('8');
  ```

- [minor][76299208e6](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/76299208e6):

  - Drop ES5 from all the flow modules

  ### Dropping CJS support in all @atlaskit packages

  As a breaking change, all @atlaskit packages will be dropping cjs distributions and will only distribute esm. This means all distributed code will be transpiled, but will still contain `import` and
  `export` declarations.

  The major reason for doing this is to allow us to support multiple entry points in packages, e.g:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/colors`;
  ```

  Previously this was sort of possible for consumers by doing something like:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/dist/esm/colors`;
  ```

  This has a couple of issues. 1, it treats the file system as API making internal refactors harder, we have to worry about how consumers might be using things that aren't _actually_ supposed to be used. 2. We are unable to do this _internally_ in @atlaskit packages. This leads to lots of packages bundling all of theme, just to use a single color, especially in situations where tree shaking fails.

  To support being able to use multiple entrypoints internally, we unfortunately cannot have multiple distributions as they would need to have very different imports from of their own internal dependencies.

  ES Modules are widely supported by all modern bundlers and can be worked around in node environments.

  We may choose to revisit this solution in the future if we find any unintended condequences, but we see this as a pretty sane path forward which should lead to some major bundle size decreases, saner API's and simpler package architecture.

  Please reach out to #fabric-build (if in Atlassian) or create an issue in [Design System Support](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=24670) (for external) if you have any questions or queries about this.
