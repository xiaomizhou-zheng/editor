The goal of `@atlaskit/radio` is to take `@atlaskit/field-radio-group` and refactor it to:

- normalize the API using conventions that have developed within ADG3 and the React ecosystem
- refactor out the Stateless/Stateful paradigm in favor of a more maintainable, conditionally controlled component
- export more granular components to enable the consumption of atlaskit radio components for more use cases

## Exports

Previously in `@atlaskit/field-radio-group` the following components were exported:

- `AkRadioGroup` (default)
- `AkRadioGroupStateless`
- `AkRadio`

`@atlaskit/radio` no longer has a default export. Furthermore, the following components are exported instead:

- `RadioGroup`
- `Radio`

## Radio group

While `@atlaskit/field-radio-group` exported a stateful and stateless version of the `RadioGroup` component, `@atlaskit/radio` has opted to unify these two components into a single conditionally controlled component.

In `@atlaskit/field-radio-group`, users would pass in an items array to be rendered as a set of `Radio` components. The shape of this items array is more or less the same in `@atlaskit/radio`, however the prop has now been renamed options to be more semantically consistent with other components of similar concern.

Other core changes are the following prop additions:

- `value`: This is an optional prop that is compared against the value of each passed in option. The matching option will be instantiated as a `Radio` component with `isChecked` set to `true`. If this prop is left undefined, the selection of any given radio is managed internally within the state of the `RadioGroup` component.
- `defaultValue`: This is an optional prop that is set as the value in state initially. Further interactions with radio options rendered by this `RadioGroup` will override this value with the internally managed checked state.
- `onRadioChange` in `@atlaskit/field-radio-group` is now `onChange` in `@atlaskit/radio`.

Additionally, while `defaultChecked` use to be a valid property within the passed in items array in `field-radio-group`; this is no longer the case in `@atlaskit/radio`, as the responsibility of this property is now passed up to the `defaultValue` prop on the `RadioGroup` component.

## Radio

The `isChecked` prop in `field-radio-group` has been replaced with the `isChecked` prop in`@atlaskit/radio`, to inline it with conventions established both in native radio elements and within the context of React.

`value` used to accept a string in field-radio-base; this has now been expanded to accept both number and string values.
