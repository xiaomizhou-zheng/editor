## Usage

Use radio groups when you want someone to select a single option from a list. For example, choosing a day of the week.

Radio groups are always stacked vertically.

## Behavior

When the radio group is focused on, the selection can be changed with the arrow keys. If it is disabled, the cursor will indicate that a selection can’t be made.

## Best practices

- It’s best to use radio buttons to describe complex choices or to provide all available options.
- List options in a logical order:
  - most likely to least likely to be selected
  - simplest to most complex operation
  - least to most risk
- Make one radio group option the default. Select the safest, most secure, and private option first. If safety and security aren’t factors, select the most likely or convenient option.
- If you need an unselected state, add a radio group with a **None** option.
- If you can’t have a list of all possible options, add an **Other** option.
- Avoid putting things in alphabetical order as this is language dependent and doesn’t localize well.
- Make sure choices don’t overlap. For example, Select age: 0-20, 20-40 — what do you pick if your age is 20?
- Try not to forget choices. For example, Select age: Below 20, above 20 — what do you pick if you are 20?
