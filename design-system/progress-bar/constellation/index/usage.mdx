## Usage

A progress bar shows the completion status of an ongoing task. It also indicates whether a user can leave the current view.

Use a progress bar when you can determine the percentage of the completed task at any time. This can include uploading files or upgrading an application. 

## Anatomy

1. Progress line: The visual representation of the progress.
2. Progress bar container: Determine the length of the bar by the available screen space.

## Content guidelines

- Use helper text with a progress bar if the process is complex or has a long wait time. This lets users know what sub-processes are taking place.
- Use a success state when the actions required to continue have been fulfilled.
