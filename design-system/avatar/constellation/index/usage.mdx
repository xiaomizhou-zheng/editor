## Usage

An avatar acts as a proxy for a user or entity (such as a project, repository, or space), in a product. They're often combined with status or presence indicators to give more context. Users generally upload their own image, otherwise, a default image is displayed.

#### Use:

- circular avatars to quickly identify users
- square avatars to help identify large product entities like projects, spaces, groups, rooms, or repositories
- a presence indicator to indicate presence for a single user
- a status icon to indicate a user’s status in a product

## Anatomy

![Avatar Anatomy](images/anatomy.png)

1. **Body:** The image representing the user or entity.
2. **Status:** An icon that displays the avatar’s status.
3. **Presence:** Indicates if a user is available, away, focused, or busy.

## Best practices

Check you’re using the appropriately sized shape and sized avatar for your use case.

## Accessibility

- Use the `name` prop to ensure there is an alternative text equivalent for screen readers.
- To avoid confusion, do not use a [tooltip with an avatar](examples#displaying-a-tooltip) when it is non-interactive or disabled, as the tooltip may not work consistently for keyboard users and screen readers.
