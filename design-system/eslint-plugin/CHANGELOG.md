## 4.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [`19d72473dfb`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/19d72473dfb) - The no-unsafe-design-token-usage eslint rule now respects the new token naming conventions when auto-fixing by correctly formatting token ids.

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`52fbe80eeb5`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/52fbe80eeb5) - Moved logic for detecting deprecated tokens out of no-unsafe-design-token-usage and moves it into a new rule: no-deprecated-token-usage. This rule is solely reponsible for catching usage of deprecated tokens. In most cases this allows consumers to set this rule to "warn", allowing iterative migration to new token names rather than in a big bang.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies

## 4.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [`7da1a30902a`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/7da1a30902a) - Adds missing meta to `ensure-design-token-usage` rule.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`a2f953f3814`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/a2f953f3814) - Previously the `ensure-design-token-usage` eslint rule contained all checks relating to token use. This has now been split up into two separate rules:

  `ensure-design-token-usage` now covers:

  - `legacyElevation` â€” warns about old usages of the elevation mixins or styles, which instead should use the `card` or `overlay` tokens.
  - `hardCodedColor` â€” warns about use of hard-coded colors such as `color: colors.B100`, which instead should be wrapped in a `token()` call. This covers the majority of cases in existing codebases when first adopting tokens.

  `no-unsafe-design-token-usage` (new) covers the remaining rules:

  - `directTokenUsage` â€” warns against using the CSS Custom Property name that is output in the browser by the `token()` call.
    Eg. directly using `var(--ds-accent-subtleBlue)` is bad.
  - `staticToken` â€” warns when tokens aren't used inline. Inlining the token usages helps with static analysis, which unlocks future improvements.
    Eg. pulling the token out into a const like `css={ color: token(primaryButtonText) }` is bad.
  - `invalidToken` â€” warns when using a token that doesn't exist (not one that's been renamed, see the next point).
  - `tokenRenamed` â€” warns when using a token that's been renamed in a subsequent release.
  - `tokenFallbackEnforced` â€” warns if a fallback for the token call is not provided.
    Eg. call with the fallback like this `token('color.background.disabled', N10)` instead of `token('color.background.disabled')`.
  - `tokenFallbackRestricted` â€” the opposite of `tokenFallbackEnforced`.
    Eg. do not pass in a fallback like this `token('color.background.disabled', N10)` and instead only include the token `token('color.background.disabled')`.

  Upgrading â€” some instances of `\\eslint-disable` may need to be changed to the new rule. If you have failing lint rules after only bumping this package then switch those ignores to use `no-unsafe-design-token-usage` instead.

### Patch Changes

- [`f460cc7c411`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/f460cc7c411) - Builds for this package now pass through a tokens babel plugin, removing runtime invocations of the tokens() function and improving bundle size.
- [`26719f5b7b0`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/26719f5b7b0) - Update @atlaskit tokens dependency from a devDependency to a regular dependency
- [`a66711cd58c`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/a66711cd58c) - Remove `@atlaskit/tokens` from peer dependency.

## 3.0.0

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [`b6a55ffa092`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/b6a55ffa092) - Introduces fixes for various edge-cases and false positives:

  - Objects that are not considered "style blocks" are now ignored. Style blocks are considered as objects assigned to variables with names containing either "style", "css", or "theme" and type annotations including "CSSProperties" or "CSSObject".
  - Hexadecimal colors using the `0x` notation are now ignored

  Increasing the linting surface-area:

  - Colors used in shorthand css property values will now be linted against. (ie `border: solid 1px red`)
  - Strings passed directly into JSX attributes (props) are now linted (ie `<Button color="red" />`)

  General improvements:

  - Color names will now only match against "whole" words. Meaning strings that inadvertently include color names like the "tan" in "standard" will no longer fail.

  - Template literal styles are now linted against property values only. Meaning css property names that include colors like `white-space: nowrap` used in template literals will no longer error

  - Increased test coverage
