# no-unsafe-design-token-usage

Disallow usage of non-existent or deleted design tokens. Optionally will disallow token usage without fallbacks specified.

```css
a {
  color: var(--ds-background-brand, #e9f2ff);
  /*         â†‘ Deprecated tokens like this */
}
```

## Autofix

Replaces deleted tokens with the recommended replacement token. This may not work if the token has been hard deleted.

## Options

`true`

The following patterns are considered problems:

```css
/* Does not exist */
p {
  color: var(--ds-non-existent);
}
```

```css
/* Deleted token */
div {
  background-color: var(--ds-background-overlay);
}
```

The following patterns are _not_ considered problems:

```css
div {
  background-color: var(--ds-surface-overlay);
}
```

`shouldEnsureFallbackUsage: true`

Ensures the CSS variable has a fallback specified.

The following patterns are considered problems:

```css
/* Missing a fallback */
a {
  color: var(--ds-text-brand);
}
```

The following patterns are _not_ considered problems:

```css
div {
  background-color: var(--ds-surface-overlay, #ffffff);
}
```
