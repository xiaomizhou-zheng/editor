## 13.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [`c7c2083475d`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/c7c2083475d) - [ux] - Adds `appearance` prop that allows you to choose between three brand-approved appearances: `brand`, `neutral` and `inverse`. These will be based on design tokens and theme-responsive.

  - Deprecates the `iconColor`, `iconGradientStart`, `iconGradientEnd` and `textColor` props. They will still be supported in the immediate future but the goal is to shift usages towards using the `appearance` prop.

## 13.7.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies

## 13.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [`0793be315f4`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/0793be315f4) - [ux] This is an update to clearly mark all deprecated Logo exports as deprecated and slated for removal in the next major release. In the next verion we will be removing the following deprecated exports from the main entrypoint:

  - `StrideIcon`, `StrideLogo`, `StrideWordmark`
  - `HipchatIcon`, `HipchatLogo`, `HipchatWordmark`
  - `JiraCoreIcon`, `JiraCoreLogo`, `JiraCoreWordmark` (use `JiraWorkManagement` + `Icon`|`Logo`|`Wordmark` instead)
  - `JiraServiceDeskIcon`, `JiraServiceDeskLogo`, `JiraServiceDeskWordmark` (use `JiraServiceManagement` + `Icon`|`Logo`|`Wordmark` instead)
  - `OpsGenieIcon`, `OpsGenieLogo`, `OpsGenieWordmark` (use `Opsgenie` with a lowercase 'g' + `Icon`|`Logo`|`Wordmark` instead)

  We will also be removing the following deprecated exports from the `@atlaskit/logo/constants` entrypoint:

  - `Props` (use `LogoProps` instead)
  - `DefaultProps` (use `defaultLogoParams` instead)

  ## Codemod

  To help with this migration, we have provided a codemod that you can run to automatically update your imports (it will leave a comment if you are using a logo with no alternative). This codemod has been around for a while, but we've updated it in this release.

  Once you've upgraded `@atlaskit/logo`, use the Atlaskit codemod CLI. See [documentation on DAC](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/framework/atlassian-frontend/codemods/01-atlassian-codemods/) for general codemod guidance.

  Without setting options in your terminal command, you can run the following and type to search for `logo` and select `@atlaskit/logo: 13.6.0-rename-imports` from the interactive CLI.

  ```
  npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli [TARGET_PATH]`
  ```

  For a TypeScript codebase, a more detailed command might look something like this.

  ```
  npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli --ignore-pattern node_modules --parser tsx --extensions js,jsx,ts,tsx ./packages
  ```

  For a Flow codebase, you will want to use `--parser babylon` instead of `--parser flow`.

  ## Design System ESLint Plugin

  We've also updated `@atlaskit/eslint-plugin-design-system` to add new restrictions to these imports. If you haven't already, we recommend installing this plugin and enabling the rules in your ESLint config. For now, documentation for the plugin resides on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-mirror/src/master/design-system/eslint-plugin/).

## 13.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [`4caed6d5063`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/4caed6d5063) - Refactors logo converting it from class components to functional components.

## 13.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [`0017d2a8439`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/0017d2a8439) - Since the logo, icon and workmard components of JiraCore, JiraServiceDesk, OpsGenie, Stride and Hipchat are deprecated in `@atlaskit/logo`, we provided a codemod to help consumers upgrade their components.

  **Running the codemod cli**

  To run the codemod: **You first need to have the latest avatar installed before you can run the codemod**

  `yarn upgrade @atlaskit/logo`

  Once upgraded, use the Atlaskit codemod-cli;

  `npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli --parser [PARSER] --extensions [FILE_EXTENSIONS] [TARGET_PATH]`

  Or run `npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli -h` for more details on usage. For Atlassians, refer to this doc for more details on the codemod CLI.

  - Drop ES5 from all the flow modules

  ### Dropping CJS support in all @atlaskit packages

  As a breaking change, all @atlaskit packages will be dropping cjs distributions and will only distribute esm. This means all distributed code will be transpiled, but will still contain `import` and
  `export` declarations.

  The major reason for doing this is to allow us to support multiple entry points in packages, e.g:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/colors`;
  ```

  Previously this was sort of possible for consumers by doing something like:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/dist/esm/colors`;
  ```

  This has a couple of issues. 1, it treats the file system as API making internal refactors harder, we have to worry about how consumers might be using things that aren't _actually_ supposed to be used. 2. We are unable to do this _internally_ in @atlaskit packages. This leads to lots of packages bundling all of theme, just to use a single color, especially in situations where tree shaking fails.

  To support being able to use multiple entrypoints internally, we unfortunately cannot have multiple distributions as they would need to have very different imports from of their own internal dependencies.

  ES Modules are widely supported by all modern bundlers and can be worked around in node environments.

  We may choose to revisit this solution in the future if we find any unintended condequences, but we see this as a pretty sane path forward which should lead to some major bundle size decreases, saner API's and simpler package architecture.

  Please reach out to #fabric-build (if in Atlassian) or create an issue in [Design System Support](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=24670) (for external) if you have any questions or queries about this.
