## Usage

Use toggles when your intent is to turn something on or off instantly, for example, if you need to enable public access to a resource.

If a physical switch would work for the action, a toggle is probably the best component to use.

## Best practices

- Use a pairing label with your toggle using `id` and `htmlFor` props to set the relationship. For more information see [labels on MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label).
- Let people know what happens when the toggle is switched by using a [tooltip](/components/tooltip).
- Toggles should never require users to press a button to apply the settings.

## Content guidelines

When writing tooltips for toggle states, be short and concise and follow the [writing guidelines](/content/writing-style).

## Server

[Toggles](https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/latest/docs/toggle-button.html) are larger in AUIâ€™s implementation.

- To be able to select options that require a button press to apply the setting use a [checkbox](/components/checkbox).
- Use a [dropdown menu](/components/dropdown-menu) to select a single option from a list.
- Use [radio buttons](/components/radio) to select a single option from a set of visible options.
- A [tooltip](/components/tooltip) should be used to explain what happens when a toggle is switched on or off.
