### Major Changes

- [`da6f3ca7ff`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/da6f3ca7ff) - ### Brief

  The ultimate goal of this major for toggle is to improve the component's performance, by both
  reducing static structure or avoiding unnecessary function calls.

  Some big changes are made as following:

  - merged stateful and stateless component
  - replace `styled-components` to `emotion` as styling library
  - restructure DOM element to reduce size
  - using latest analytics-next

  #### Stateful vs Stateless

  We've merged `Toggle` and `ToggleStateless` in this major, internally we distinguish those two
  different behaviours by props a user passed in. In React documents, it's recommended to use `controlled components` to implement forms [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html), while there are cases you might need a different approach instead, there is a [detailed discussion](https://goshakkk.name/controlled-vs-uncontrolled-inputs-react/) here that can help you to decide which way to go.

  When `defaultChecked` is passed in, that means you want it to be `stateful` and the component will have a `state` reflecting `checked` or `unchecked` all by itself. In contrast, if `defaultChecked` is absent, it turns to a stateless component and you have to control it on you own, by using `isChecked` prop.

  When both are provided, it will always be a stateful component.

  #### Upgrading with codemod

  ```
  # You first need to have the latest toggle installed before you can run the codemod
  yarn upgrade @atlaskit/toggle@^12.0.0

  # Run the codemod cli
  # Pass in a parser for your codebase
  npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli /path/to/target/directory --parser [tsx | flow | babel]
  ```

## 11.0.3

### Patch Changes

  This requires version 3.8 of Typescript, read more about how we handle Typescript versions here: https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/get-started
  Also add `typescript` to `devDependencies` to denote version that the package was built with.

## 9.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`74b9e80533`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/74b9e80533) - **BREAKING** - The `label` prop has been removed.
  If wanting to pair your toggle with a `label` element make sure to use the freshly introduced `id` prop!

  Before:

  ```js
  <Toggle label="Allow pull requests" />
  ```

  After (we use Emotion here - but you can use any equivalent library):

  ```js
  /** @jsx jsx */
  import { jsx } from '@emotion/core';
  import { visuallyHidden } from '@atlaskit/theme/constants';

  <label css={visuallyHidden()} htmlFor="my-toggle">Allow pull requests</label>
  <Toggle id="my-toggle" />
  ```

  This now also allows you to visually show a label (just omit the visually hidden mixin) -
  which for the most part you'll want to do.
  Read [the design docs](https://atlassian.design/guidelines/product/components/toggles) for more inspiration.

  Happy toggling!

### Minor Changes

- [`5ab389c082`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/5ab389c082) - Adds an `id` prop for you to use with a pairing label element, for use like so:

  ```js
  import Toggle from '@atlaskit/toggle';

  <label htmlFor="my-toggle">Do the thing</label>
  <Toggle id="my-toggle" />
  ```

  - Drop ES5 from all the flow modules

  ### Dropping CJS support in all @atlaskit packages

  As a breaking change, all @atlaskit packages will be dropping cjs distributions and will only distribute esm. This means all distributed code will be transpiled, but will still contain `import` and
  `export` declarations.

  The major reason for doing this is to allow us to support multiple entry points in packages, e.g:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/colors`;
  ```

  Previously this was sort of possible for consumers by doing something like:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/dist/esm/colors`;
  ```

  This has a couple of issues. 1, it treats the file system as API making internal refactors harder, we have to worry about how consumers might be using things that aren't _actually_ supposed to be used. 2. We are unable to do this _internally_ in @atlaskit packages. This leads to lots of packages bundling all of theme, just to use a single color, especially in situations where tree shaking fails.

  To support being able to use multiple entrypoints internally, we unfortunately cannot have multiple distributions as they would need to have very different imports from of their own internal dependencies.

  ES Modules are widely supported by all modern bundlers and can be worked around in node environments.

  We may choose to revisit this solution in the future if we find any unintended condequences, but we see this as a pretty sane path forward which should lead to some major bundle size decreases, saner API's and simpler package architecture.

  Please reach out to #fabric-build (if in Atlassian) or create an issue in [Design System Support](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=24670) (for external) if you have any questions or queries about this.
