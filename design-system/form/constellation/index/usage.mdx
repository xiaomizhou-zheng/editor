## Usage

Use forms when user input is required to complete some action. Forms direct users to provide and submit relevant information such as changing personal settings or creating a Jira issue.

Common form components include [text fields](/components/textfield/examples), [selects](/components/select/examples), [radio buttons](/components/radio/examples), [checkboxes](/components/checkbox/examples), [date pickers](/components/datetime-picker/date-picker/examples), [toggles](/components/toggle/examples), and [buttons](/components/button/examples).

## Anatomy

![Form Anatomy](../images/form-anatomy.png)

1. **Title:** Use a concise form title. This helps the user understand the form’s context.
2. **Labels:** Standard label alignment is left-aligned with the field underneath. Use a combination of a concise label and supportive helper text for clarification of field input.
3. **Placeholder text:** Avoid placeholders when possible. Never use placeholder text to communicate critical information — this is not accessible. Instead, use field labels or helper text to describe the purpose of the field and how to use it. Placeholders can, however, be used for search fields or some short example entries.
4. **Required field**: Clearly communicate fields that are required. Don’t rely on asterisks alone to communicate which fields are required. 
5. **Form section:** Group information logically into form sections.
6. **Disabled fields:** Show disabled fields if users need to know what controls might not be available to them.
7. **Form footer:** Always use a submit button and distinguish primary and secondary buttons.


## Best practices

### General

Persist forms on refresh so that user data isn’t lost.

### Layout

Group related sections into logical sets to allow users to understand the information they need to enter.

<DoDont
  type="do"
  image={{
    url: FormGroupingDo,
    alt: 'Form with relevant information grouped into sections'
  }}
>
  Group related information into form sections.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
  type="dont"
  image={{
    url: FormGroupingDont,
    alt: 'Single form has unrelated information'
  }}
>
  Provide one form of unrelated information.
</DoDont>

Use one form column to enable fast field comprehension.

<DoDont
  type="do"
  image={{
    url: FormOneColumnDo,
    alt: 'Form with information in one column'
  }}
>
  Use one form column.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
  type="dont"
  image={{
    url: FormOneColumnDont,
    alt: 'Form with information in two columns'
  }}
>
  Use multiple form columns.
</DoDont>

Max-width: **624px**, recommended by the [cozy grid](/foundations/grid#gutter-spacing). In other cases, assume that the width typically follows where the form lives in (Modal, focused task, page, etc.)

### Fields and labels

- Reduce the number of fields in your form to avoid a large cognitive load on users (or to help users submit the form faster).
- Avoid optional fields by only asking users for relevant information.
- Avoid using default selections, or, instead, use smart defaults (e.g. preselect user's country based on location data).
- Always include a visual label outside with an input field. Don't use placeholder text in place of labels. (The only exception to this is for search fields, which often have icons or other indicators of purpose.)

<DoDont
  type="do"
  image={{
    url: FormDefaultValuesDo,
    alt: 'Form with information in one column'
  }}
>
  Provide smart default values.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
  type="dont"
  image={{
    url: FormDefaultValuesDont,
    alt: 'Form with information in two columns'
  }}
>
  Provide random default values.
</DoDont>

Use input masks to help users understand correct field formats.

<DoDont
  type="do"
  image={{
    url: FormInputMasksDo,
    alt: 'Form field has input mask applied'
  }}
>
  Use input masks to help users understand fields correctly.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
  type="dont"
  image={{
    url: FormInputMasksDont,
    alt: 'Form field does not have input mask applied'
  }}
>
  Use default inputs for particular fields.
</DoDont>

### Buttons

- State the action that the buttons perform when clicked.
- Avoid multiple action buttons and avoid a reset button. This will reduce confusion about how to submit the form.

<DoDont
  type="do"
  image={{
    url: FormMultipleActionButtonsDo,
    alt: 'Form with clear submit button in the footer'
  }}
>
  Use clear, binary actions for clean form submission.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
  type="dont"
  image={{
    url: FormMultipleActionButtonsDont,
    alt: 'Form with multiple action buttons in the footer'
  }}
>
  Use multiple action buttons and a reset button at the bottom of the form.
</DoDont>

Ensure the primary action button provides feedback that the form is being submitted.

<DoDont
  type="do"
  image={{
    url: FormButtonFeedbackDo,
    alt: 'Button shows spinner when form is submitted'
  }}
>
  Give feedback to show that form is being submitted.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
  type="dont"
  image={{
    url: FormButtonFeedbackDont,
    alt: 'Button does not show anything on submit'
  }}
>
  Give no feedback on submit.
</DoDont>

### Button positioning

Buttons are sorted by importance from right to left, with the most important button (primary) on the right.

![Button positioning modal](../images/button-positioning-1.png)

![Button positioning page](../images/button-positioning-2.png)

Exceptions to this are single-page forms, flags, and section messages where buttons are left aligned with the primary button on the left.

## Accessibility

- Autofocus the first field by default. This allows users to tab through elements in the form in a logical way.
- Never disable a submit button, even if all of the required fields aren't filled in. Instead, describe what needs to be done using [validation and error messages](/content/writing-guidelines).
- Match keyboard to input on mobile.
- Avoid using placeholder text wherever possible. If you do use placeholder text, don't include any critical information only as placeholder text.
- Make sure all fields have an accessible label visible. (Search fields are sometimes an exception to this.)
- Use autocompletion to limit typing for users.
