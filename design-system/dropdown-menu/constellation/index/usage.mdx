## Usage

Dropdown menus are typically used when you have 5-15 items to choose from. They're used for navigation or command menus, where an action is initiated based on the selection.

Menu items can include both [radio buttons](/components/radio) and [checkboxes](/components/checkbox).

Some other uses for dropdown menus:

A "more" menu, where the control contains an icon.

For user profiles, where the control is an [avatar](/components/avatar).

## Anatomy

1. **Control:** A button that may contain an icon, or be labeled with text.
1. **Trigger:** Used if the button is labeled with text.
1. **Menu:** Container for links and action items.

## Behavior

In cases where a menu item is longer than the button's text label, the menu will grow to the width of the longest item listed. However, there is a maximum width specified by the component. If the menu item exceeds the maximum width it will be truncated.

## Best practices

- A number of components can be used to give people the ability to select options. See the list of related components below for advice on choosing the right one.
- When organizing dropdown menu items, sort the list in a logical order by putting the most selected option at the top, if known. Test and refine over time to re-evaluate if all menu items are needed.
- For long lists, group related menu items. If including radio buttons and checkboxes as menu items, try grouping related actions.
- Grouped items are separated by a short, uppercase title that describes the options in that sub-category.

## Content guidelines

- People navigate menus and choose menu items based on their labels, so it’s important that they're accurate and informative.
- In general, use sentence case and write concise labels that clearly indicate the purpose of the selection.
- For action menu items, use verbs and verb phrases to describe the action that occurs when the item is chosen. For example, “Move”, “Log time”, or “Hide epic labels”.
- In most cases, links should be nouns. For example, Profile or Keyboard shortcuts.
- Exclude articles in menu items. For example, use "Add flag" instead of "Add a flag".
- Keep menu items to a single line of text.
