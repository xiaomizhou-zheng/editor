        Sydney, capital of New South Wales and one of Australia's largest
        cities, is best known for its harbourfront Sydney Opera House, with a
        distinctive sail-like design. Massive Darling Harbour and the smaller
        Circular Quay port are hubs of waterside life, with the arched Harbour
        Bridge and esteemed Royal Botanic Garden nearby. Sydney Towerâ€™s outdoor
        platform, the Skywalk, offers 360-degree views of the city and suburbs.
