  ### Option 1: Instantiate a \`MentionResource\`

  You can choose to instantiate the existing MentionResource that have defaults in place.

  Ensure you plug in the \`mentionNameResolver\` to resolve names that have been pre-selected in the Editor
  (else they will show up as @Unknown). You will need a backing service to search and resolve names.

  ${code`
  import { MentionResource, MentionProvider } from '@atlaskit/mention';

  const EditorWithMentions = () => {
    const mentionProvider = new MentionResource({
      url:
        'https://atlassian-product-url.net/get-users', // URL to search users
      productId: 'atlassian-product',
      mentionNameResolver: {
        lookupName: async (id: string) => {
          const resolved = await resolveUser(id); // custom function to resolve IDs to names
          return resolved;
        },
        cacheName: (id: string, name: string) =>
          this.mentionNames.set(id, { id, name, status: MentionNameStatus.OK }), // cache your resolved IDs
      },
    });

    return(
      <Editor
        mentionProvider={Promise.resolve(mentionResourceProvider)} // Plug in your Mentions provider
      />
    )
  }`}

  ### Option 2: Extend and instantiate an \`AbstractMentionResource\`

  Extend the \`AbstractMentionResource\` to provide a more customized mentions experience.

  ${(
    <Example
      packageName="@atlaskit/mention"
      Component={MentionWithEditorExample}
      title="Mention With Editor"
      source={MentionWithEditorExampleSource}
    />
  )}

  ### Option 3: Extend and instantiate a \`SmartMentionResource\`

  The Smart Mention Resource is now available to use at @atlassian/smart-mention-resource

  This is only available for internal use.
